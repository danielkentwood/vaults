## Project Summary


## Tasks
#### 1. Pre-eclampsia NBA
- [ ] [Analysis](https://github.aetna.com/pharmacy-services-segment/maternity/pull/446/files)
	- [ ] Write code to measure current NBA (7/2021-Present)
		- [ ] Add infants to analysis (we want to track ICU stays--and infant costs generally--because these are the primary drivers of excess cost during a pre-eclampsia episode)
			- Two older branches (overlapping changes) that have started working on this: [here](https://github.aetna.com/pharmacy-services-segment/maternity/pull/187) and [here](https://github.aetna.com/pharmacy-services-segment/maternity/pull/182) 
			- Also, [here]() is code I used to generate infant features when I was sizing the pre-eclampsia campaign
		- [ ] Ensure that our pulling of delivered kits (from ATV tables) is accurate/comprehensive. Align with the RMO team to see if someone can validate/review the code. Another person who may be able to help is Meredith Borine. 
		- [ ] 
	- [ ] Analyze original campaign (6/2020-6/2021)
		- [ ] 
		- Note: this is a request from maternity product. Keep Wengora Thompson in the loop.
	- [ ] Campaign tracking
		- [ ] Create dashboard
		- [ ] Volume is higher than anticipated due to switching to the ACOG rules (instead of the model) for targeting in April. Given current usage and remaining stock, project when we will run out of kits.

	- [ ] Flesh out the [analysis PR](https://github.aetna.com/pharmacy-services-segment/maternity/pull/446/files) description
