# The CODE system of notetaking

The CODE system of notetaking was developed by, I think, Tiago Forte in his book _Building a Second Brain_. 

* **C**apture
* **O**rganize
* **D**istill
* **E**xpress

#### [[explore and exploit]]

The first two steps (i.e., capture and organize) are part of what Forte calls the _divergent_ phase of the creative process. In this phase, we are exploring: we are gathering resources, looking for valuable information, and refusing to dig too deeply into any particular resource.

The second two steps (i.e., distill and express) constitute Forte's _convergent_ phase. Here, we are exploiting valuable information from our exploration. We are synthesizing ideas. 

## Exploration Phase
### C: Capture

### O: Organize

## Exploitation Phase

### D: Distill

### E: Express
