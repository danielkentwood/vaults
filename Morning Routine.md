### Starting the day
#### Do immediately
* Stick to your daily [[π Quantified Self]] measurements. Your health > your job. Complete at least one (but ideally more) self-tracking item 
* Review high-level goals (personal and career). Internalize and implement [[EOY review directives]] and [[current Aetna goals]]
* Block out today's calendar with planned activities, leaving at least 5 min between activities for reflection, energy audit, etc. Include time for lunch, stretching/exercising, and brief personal time.
* Evaluate each item in the calendar based on how it helps you reach your high-level goals:
	- Does it move you forward or slow you down? Is it energizing or draining? 
	- Are you the right person to be doing it? Are you the only person who can do it?
	- After considering all of the above, should you delegate it? 

> [!Reminder]
> Stick to your [[π personal notetaking system]]!
> * Capture information and ideas effectively
> 	* Refactor new atomic ideas into zettels
> 	* Link out to zettels as much as possible!
> 	* Every meeting gets its own note
> 	* People are nodes! (especially in meetings)
> * Effective task management
> 	* Zero backlog via ruthless task triage (do, delegate, kill, reschedule)
> 	* Tasks should always have a project
> 		* if you put a due date on every task, you'll be overloaded and you'll stop paying attention to the daily task list.
> 		* if they are urgent/important, schedule a due date and a halfway checkpoint
> 		* otherwise, set a `todo` value
> 			* if the task involves a "should" or "it would be cool", use `todo`
> * During the final 30 minutes of the day, go back over your notes and ensure that you have followed your funnel. 

* Every day at work is more material for a book. *Write down everything!*
