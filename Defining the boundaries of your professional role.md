Just as we need to work consistently on defining the boundaries of our self, we also need to do the same with our professional role. 

Workplace dynamics involves lots of bidding to take on or offload tasks. If you are passive and boundary-less, you will spin your wheels and get frustrated as you (1) fail to signal to yourself and others which kinds of tasks you should be doing, and (2) overload your schedule because you don't know how or when to say no if people try to delegate to you.

You need to actively craft and project a clear professional identity: 
- These are the projects I'm leading
- This is the scope of tasks I handle; aside from rare exceptions, I will politely reject tasks that aren't within this scope
