# Finding happiness today
parent:: [[∑ Tabernacles]]

When I was given this topic, I immediately thought of the words of Brigham Young:

“I want present salvation. I preach, comparatively, but little about the eternities and Gods, and their wonderful works in eternity; and do not tell who first made them, nor how they were made; for I know nothing about that. Life is for us, and it is for us to receive it today, and not wait for the millenium. Let us take a course to be saved today . . . If we are saved, we are happy, we are filled with light, glory, intelligence, and we pursue a course to enjoy the blessings that the Lord has in store for us. If we continue to pursue that course, it produces just the thing we want, that is, to be saved at this present moment."

I also thought of the words of Amulek:

[Alma 34:31](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/34.31?lang=eng#30)

31 Yea, I would that ye would come forth and harden not your hearts any longer; for behold, now is the time and the day of your salvation; and therefore, if ye will repent and harden not your hearts, immediately shall the great plan of redemption be brought about unto you.

It is my testimony that the gospel of Christ brings happiness, and that we do not need to wait until the next life to enjoy it. Indeed, Christ and his prophets seem really anxious to tell us that we will not be magically transformed into happy people after death if we are unhappy during this life. I’m grateful for the opportunity to talk about our responsibility to make the world a better place today, in the present moment.

When I started writing this talk, I went down the road of thinking of all the things that make happiness difficult. I thought: if we can clearly identify the problems, the solutions will be more readily apparent. I intended to mention studies that show how spectacularly bad we are at remembering what has made us happy in the past, how bad we are at guessing what will make us happy in the future, and, oddly enough, how bad we are at identifying the things that are making us happy or sad right this very moment. I intended to talk about how relativistic our happiness is—how it depends on how happy we remember being, how happy we can imagine ourselves being, and how happy we think other people around us are.

Somewhere in all of these thoughts, I was struck—not for the first time in my life—with an idea that I’m sure we’ve all had before: that even though it is important to find happiness in this life, it is not a good idea to try and look for it. Not only is it too elusive to pin down intentionally; even if we could, it would be a bad idea to intentionally make happiness an end goal.

To illustrate this, I want to draw from the life of Darwin. I don’t mean the 19th century naturalist who created the theory of natural selection; I mean my dog, Darwin. When my life gets oppressively busy and anxiety weighs me down, I often find myself thinking about my dog, Darwin. He has a pretty good life, but it could be a lot better. He eats the same food every meal. His social circle is pretty small, mostly just our family and a few other friends and dogs. We don’t live in the biggest apartment, so his space is limited, especially for an athletic, 90-lb dog. But to him, all of these things are the best things imaginable. Every time I feed him, his tail is just going nuts. Every time I come home from work, he makes me feel like I’m in one of those videos where soldiers return from war and surprise their family members, and everyone is crying and collapsing for joy. This is Darwin, whimpering and shaking and leaping like a baby deer and spinning in circles involuntarily every time I come home. So during these times when I’m depressed and anxious, I sometimes catch myself wishing I could be Darwin, and live a much simpler life where just the daily, repetitive facts of my existence would fill me with so much joy that I lose full control of my bodily movements.

But then I remember a short story I once read, where a man dies and has the option to be reincarnated as any life form he desires. He wants a much simpler life, so he chooses to be a horse. In the middle of his transformation, as his brain becomes more horselike and less human, he has a final moment of clarity where he realizes that when the transformation is complete, he won’t be able to appreciate the simplicity of a horse existence, because he won’t remember or be capable of conceiving what it is like to be a complex human. He’ll have no measuring stick. Further, when he is given the chance to choose a new life form at the end of his horse life, he will be unable to understand that living a human life expands our possibilities for meaning. With this limited imagination, he will more likely choose a simpler life form, and this circle will continue until he reaches a life form incapable of evaluating and choosing between options.

This short story, which is totally fictional by the way, helps me stop wanting to be my dog.

The larger point here is that joy and happiness are not a great ultimate goal. We can increase our bliss by being ignorant, but we lose something important when we discard the complexity of human life.

As John Stuart Mill famously said, “It is better to be a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied."

This is an old idea, as old as Adam and Eve. Rather than living forever in ignorant bliss in the garden, they chose to gain firsthand knowledge of good and evil, to pass through suffering, to experience the messy ironies and contradictions of mortality. They realized that it is impossible for us to be saved in ignorance. There are things more important than happiness.

While it is true that the scriptures say that men are that they might have joy, it is important to remember that it is in this same chapter that Lehi tells us that joy is impossible without sorrow and misery. He also says that God does not (indeed, cannot) exist outside of this opposition. And perhaps this explains the fact that while the scriptures sometimes describe the afterlife as a place without sorrow, where God will wipe away the tears from our faces, they also describe God, rather often, as sorrowful, even weeping because of sorrow. Enoch sees God the Father weep over his children. We read of Christ, who was also God, weeping over the city of Jerusalem, or weeping with Mary and Martha because their brother Lazarus has just died.

Indeed, Jesus doesn’t come across as particularly happy in the scriptures. He comes across as caring, as seeking truth, as loving. Sometimes this results in happiness, but it is just as likely to result in pain (e.g., fasting in the desert, being the subject of continued ridicule, etc). Isaiah said Christ would be "despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief.” Indeed, his last mortal days were characterized by an oppressive awareness of the immense suffering ahead, and the experience of this suffering was his primary purpose in coming to earth.

Again, there are things more important than happiness. It was purpose, not happiness, that motivated Jesus. It was meaning, not joy. He is the perfect embodiment of Nietzche’s observation: “He who has a why can endure any how."

The pioneers experienced incredible hardship during their journey across the plains. When they sang, “All is well, all is well,” they were experiencing the assurance and the peace that accompanies spiritual connection with God, and in their case, a spiritual mandate from God. Above all, they had new meaning given to them on those frozen stretches of the frontier. Joy is fungible—it is interchangeable from one experience to the next. Meaning is unique, and it is this meaning that people are willing to sacrifice and die for. As much as the pioneers wended their way with joy, they also wended their way with sorrow and pain and loss, and these sacrifices added weight and gravity to their divinely inspired purpose.

Up to now, I’ve tried to talk about how we should search for meaning rather than happiness, and that this search for meaning will often suggest that sorrow is the right thing to feel. I want to end with a few words on why sorrow is not just a foil or a preparation for joy. It gets a bad rep, but it is an essential element of our loving relationships.

As a father of a 4 year old daughter, it is my solemn responsibility to gain a deep knowledge of all Disney and Pixar movies. One of their most recent films is Inside Out, in which the core emotions of a young girl named Riley are personified as Joy, Sadness, Fear, Anger, and Disgust. Throughout the movie, Joy is the leader and does everything possible to keep Riley happy, because what could be more important than being happy? Sadness only seems to mess things up and it isn’t clear what her purpose is. When Riley moves to a new city and a new school, her experiences become more complex and it is harder to keep her happy. She is lonely and misses her friends and her old hobbies, and her relationship with her parents becomes strained. In the end, Sadness, not Joy, is what saves Riley. When Sadness is allowed to gain control, Riley finally breaks down and it is a signal to others (especially Riley’s parents) that she needs help. It is Sadness that brings them together and let’s them heal and start again. The film is an elegant argument for the necessity of sorrow in our lives.

When Isaiah describes the afterlife and says that the Lord God will wipe away the tears from all faces, I don’t think he means permanently. This isn’t God saying, “OK, mortality was rough but it’s over and you can stop crying now.” Rather, it is God being an emotionally complex and responsive being that mourns with us just as much as he rejoices with us. Sorrow is connecting us with God. Without the tears, there would be no wiping of them. More than that, he mourns when we should be mourning but are not self-aware enough to know that we should be mourning; we often experience the catharsis of sorrow only after someone starts feeling it for us first. God resonates with the truth about us, regardless of what we want to believe about ourselves. It is this fixation on being true to oneself and others that characterizes God’s why, his reason for being. This is our standard. This should be our goal.

If you want to find happiness today in living the gospel, give up the search for happiness today. In the words of another important Disney character, let it go. Instead, reconnect with the truth about your why, your purpose. What is your purpose today? If you can find that purpose, you do not need to find happiness. It will eventually find you. But more importantly, you will experience the full range of human experience in ways that are truthful and appropriate for the situation. Christ invites us to work with him in loving others, lifting the fallen, bringing the outcast back into fellowship, healing, and building. As we let this become our meaning, I hope that we can open ourselves to sorrow—both of others and ourselves. It is this sorrow that most effectively drives us into each others’ arms and into the arms of God, where, incidentally, we can experience the joy that surpasses all understanding.

To add:

Without sorrow, there would be no Comforter.

Go back and read John 14-17 with this in mind. Jesus is constantly talking about the loneliness and abandonment that the apostles will feel when he is gone. He talks about the comforter. In his prayer, he talks about the union and oneness that he seeks for his followers.

[optional]

In our church culture, we’ll often hear detailed lists of motivations, and how they are ranked in order of best to worst. I typically don’t find this sort of thing very helpful, since I’m usually not totally clear about what my motivations are in most situations. However, I can at least say that, in my opinion, one of the bottom-of-the-barrel motivations is the belief that you’ll get some reward in the next life. I think it’s perfectly fine as a belief, but as a motivation, it is pretty bad, right? If the only thing that can get us motivated to be kind to others and love them is the promise of happiness in the eternities, they’ll probably pick up on it and it won’t feel very kind or loving. Also, if we believe everything is as it should be, and that the sorrow and suffering of the present is just a price we have to pay for eternal bliss, we are probably going to be less motivated to do something to alleviate the suffering now.

When we have that experience of “all is well” that comes with the spirit, it does indeed feel like everything is as it should be. While this may be true locally within the small circle of our immediate circumstance, it is in tension with the fact that all is not well elsewhere, often very close by. It is not wrong to enjoy these moments of harmony, but it is wrong to try and stay in them indefinitely. We need to break out of the comfort of that small circle of harmony and venture out into other peoples’ lives, where we will find dissonance. We expand that circle to include people and relationships in which all is not well.

The bigger the circle, the less control we have over how

While this experience quite often involves joy, it always involves a new perspective—a new meaning--

I think it is one of the central truths of the gospel that sacrifice for others bestows meaning. It is the driving truth of the atonement. It is

Our happiness is influenced by many things that we typically are not aware of.

- Our genetics. We each have a baseline amount of happiness that we tend to return to, and it is very hard to permanently change this. There is good evidence that our genetics strongly influence this.
- How happy have we been in the past? The good old days.
- How happy are other people around us?

And there is a list of things we think do (or should) influence our happiness, when in fact they have very little influence.

- Catastrophe, pain, trauma, disability, etc. (at least they don’t influence us for as long as we think they should)
- Great fortune (e.g., $1.6 Billion Powerball winnings?)
- 

Sometimes the need to be happy can paradoxically become a burden and a source of unhappiness. This is especially true when we have a need to appear happy to others. Perversely, the search for immediate happiness can be used as a way of escaping the truth.

Two things influence our ability to enjoy an experience repeatedly.

1. Time
2. Variety

We have to have experiences that recalibrate or renew our sense of how much joy is possible, and how much joy is normal.

Joy in Christ versus joy in the world.

We are horrible at knowing what will make us happy in the future.

We are horrible at even knowing whether we are happy or not.

[Genesis 3:16](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/gen/3.16?lang=eng#15)

16 Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children;

We need to find a happiness that is deeper than just a feeling of contentment when things are going our way. The happiness of getting the perfect job,

This is the type of happiness that we often seek, but it isn’t the type of happiness that we need.

We need meaning and purpose. When we have it, we will sometimes be happy and sometimes be sad.

Rather than deal with the rifts in our relationships, the neglect of our duties and sensed imperatives, the anxiety over death, we do things that will distract us. We flee. We need to escape.

Confronting our death

We spend a great deal of time talking about death in this church. More specifically, about what comes after death. The afterlife, resurrection, eternity, degrees of glory, exaltation.

[Doctrine and Covenants 131:6](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/131.6?lang=eng#5)6

It is impossible for a man to be saved in ignorance.
