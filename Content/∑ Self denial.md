What is the correct balance between self-denial and enjoyment/encouragement of our passions/appetites?

Why is self-denial important?

Social argument: Self-denial increases one’s ability to attend to the needs of others.

For my part I honour with the name of virtue the habit of acting in a way troublesome to oneself and useful to others.

[Stendhal *"de l'Amour,"* 1822]

**Stendhal is the pen name of Mari-Henri Belle**

**Romans 12:1-5** minimize the self to be a better servant and part of the body of Christ.

Individual argument: Self-denial increases happiness.

To be without some of the things you want is an indispensable part of happiness.

Bertrand Russell

Also, temporal discounting. If we are unable to hold off, we'll always choose the immediate reward and never the delayed reward that is usually more valuable.

Opposition in all things.

Physiological process of adaptation.

2 nephi 2:11, 22-23

11 For it must needs be, that there is an opposition in all things. If not so, my firstborn in the wilderness, righteousness could not be brought to pass, neither wickedness, neither holiness nor misery, neither good nor bad. Wherefore, all things must needs be a compound in one; wherefore, if it should be one body it must needs remain as dead, having no life neither death, nor corruption nor incorruption, happiness nor misery, neither sense nor insensibility.

22 And now, behold, if Adam had not transgressed he would not have fallen, but he would have remained in the garden of Eden. And all things which were created must have remained in the same state in which they were after they were created; and they must have remained forever, and had no end.23 And they would have had no children; wherefore they would have remained in a state of innocence, having no joy, for they knew no misery; doing no good, for they knew no sin.

Doctrines of self-denial?

**[Matthew 16:25](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/16.25?lang=eng#24)** For whosoever will save his life shall **lose** it: and whosoever will **lose** his life for my sake shall **find** it.

D&c 19:15-19 - Christ submits his will to the father

**2 ne 2:6-7**- we must deny ourselves, submit our own will to that of the father.

6 Wherefore, redemption cometh in and through the Holy Messiah; for he is full of grace and truth.7 Behold, he offereth himself a sacrifice for sin, to answer the ends of the law, unto all those who have a broken heart and a contrite spirit; and unto none else can the ends of the law be answered.

Moroni 10:32. Deny yourselves of all ungodliness.

Alma 39:9 Now my son, I would that ye should repent and forsake your sins, and go no more after the lusts of your eyes, but cross yourself in all these things; for except ye do this ye can in nowise inherit the kingdom of God. Oh, remember, and take it upon you, and cross yourself in these things.

D&c 112:3 abase thyself

Where do we learn about self-denial the most? Where do we get the most frequent opportunities to implement self-denial? 

Family.

William James on Fire insurance (the benefits of self-denial)

Keep the faculty of effort alive in you by a little gratuitous exercise every day. That is, be systematically ascetic or heroic in little unnecessary points, do every day or two something for no other reason than that you would rather not do it, so that when the hour of dire need draws nigh, it may find you not unnerved and untrained to stand the test. Asceticism of this sort is like the insurance which a man pays on his house and goods. The tax does him no good at the time, and possibly may never bring him a return. But if the fire does come, his having paid it will be his salvation from ruin. So with the man who has daily inured himself to habits of concentrated attention, energetic volition, and self-denial in unnecessary things. He will stand like a tower when everything rocks around him, and when his softer fellow-mortals are winnowed like chaff in the blast.

William James
