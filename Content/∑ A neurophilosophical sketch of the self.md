### Biological requirements for basic selfhood:

- Capacity to process, retain, and model information that distinguishes the organism from its environment.
    - To truly accomplish this, it needs a capacity to properly assign credit for sensory changes to the organism itself and the environment.
        - It needs sensory apparatus
        - It needs motor apparatus
        - It needs the predictive machinery of a corollary discharge

It is important to point out that there are things that look like this capacity, but have important differences that ultimately rule out the possibility of selfhood. For example, a marine organism might have evolved such that when a passing current rotates its body, a vestibular reflex causes a compensatory movement to keep the organism on course. However, when the organism itself produces a movement that results in the exact same rotation of its body, that compensatory reflex is inhibited. This is not the same thing as the predictive machinery described above, and it does not require a model that distinguishes between body and world. It just requires a single inhibitory wire to bypass a reflex. No concerns about the sensory consequences of its actions. No central nervous system required. The body/world credit-assignment problem is only solved when the brain predicts the sensory consequences of its own actions. And for this to be possible, there must be two models: a statistical model of the sensory world and a statistical model of how that sensory world changes when the body intervenes in it. 

But so far, I’m being ambiguous about the directionality of this relationship between credit-assignment and the models. Are the body and world models necessary to enable credit-assignment? Or is accurate credit-assignment required to build the models of the body and world? I’m being ambiguous because the answer is that the arrow points both ways. Or, rather, it is a circle. The models inform the predicted sensory consequences of a movement. The movement happens and the sensory consequences occur. A prediction error is calculated by subtracting the prediction from the sensation. This prediction error is fed back to the model, which updates and refines its mapping between actions and their predicted consequences.

To sum up: assigning credit is one of the fundamental tasks of the mammalian nervous system. In order to generate movement successfully, a mammal must be able to properly assign credit for changing sensory inputs to (1) its body and (2) the world. Why did my visual input change? Did the world change? Or did I change my position in the world? If both, then how much of each? Without answering these questions, the nervous system would never be able to predict in advance the outcome of a given movement.

There are plenty of organisms that don't care about credit assignment when it comes to movement. Their movements are pure sensory-based reflexes. They have no need for a model of the respective contributions of their body and the world to the changes in sensory input. 

What is the advantage of having a model? Why is it advantageous to be able to predict sensory consequences of movement? Is it necessary for arbitrary, complex movements? 

Other than the presence of self-referential information, this doesn't quite resemble what most of us think of when we think of a self. But this is the foundation for the more elaborate form(s) of selfhood that we enjoy as humans. It is, in an abstract algorithmic sense, the necessary conditions for selfhood. But the concrete instantiation of this algorithm depends upon the idiosyncratic needs of the organism.

For example, I can imagine that smell plays a much larger part in defining the self in canines/lupines than it does in humans. They have a much richer olfactory environment. What needs are being addressed by their heightened sense of smell? They can navigate, they can establish ownership and dominance over geographical scales, they can find food and avoid predators and rivals and toxins, and they can identify other individual dogs/wolves.

### Integration

Integration of new information into models. Mathematically, integration is a way of compressing dimensions. Taking variation in one dimension and summing it over the remaining dimensions.  For our discussion of the self, "incorporation" is a term that I really like to describe this.

- Body schema is an integration, but literally an incorporation.
- Trauma integrated into autobiographical self
    - The autobiographical self is an integrated history; it is an explicit account of how am I currently unique and different, and also, how I am an instantiation of this or that group (or kind of person), but I can arrive at that current assessment by integrating/incorporating over my past (and, in a sense, my imagined future).

**The weight of selfhood, as it is typically experienced, is the weight of the struggle to interpret one's behavior (primarily social) as having clear boundaries. In the physical sense, the boundaries of the self are much clearer, and ambiguity is typically resolved rapidly (although there can be disorders, illusions, and deficiencies at this level also). At the social/normative level, we experience our boundaries as a bayesian integration between our ideals (inherited and self-generated) and our history of honoring those ideals.**

Why is there a difference in the level of explicit thematic awareness we experience in social selfhood as opposed to sensorimotor selfhood? It is precisely because the error signals are much less ambiguous at the sensorimotor level, which means it is much easier to individuate with clear boundaries where the self ends and the external world begins. As a result of the ambiguity of social error signals, our predictions often fail, triggering breakdown situations where the extra resources of conscious attention are deployed in order to boost and modulate the error signal. 

What is the link between this "individuation" account and the "need/skill" account of selfhood? It isn't as simple as saying that we have a need for individuation.

- Movement occurs because of need.
- The satisfaction of that need depends upon how successful that movement is.
- Very simple needs can often be met with movements that are genetically hard wired (i.e., magnetosome in bacteria).
- Let's start with sitting upright in gravity. Where does this need come from? We have a need to make sense of incoming sensory data, and we can't do that unless we can control our body--and one of the most fundamental parts of the body to control is the trunk.
- Maybe have a section that attempts to comment on whether certain organisms have the capacity for selfhood, and what kind of selfhood they might have.

### Breakdown of the self

1. Affective breakdown
    1. Anxiety
    2. Depression
    3. Bipolar
2. Personality disorders
    1. Narcissism
    2. Borderline
3. Body ownership
    1. Alien limb
    2. Anarchic limb
    3. Body dysmorphic disorder
4. Action ownership
    1. addiction/compulsion
    2. schizophrenia
- There are necessary domains of the self and unnecessary domains of the self. The spiritual self would be an unnecessary domain. Many people live healthy, normal lives without one. The physical, cognitive, and social selves are clearly necessary for a healthy, normal life. Many institutions and cultures have tried to pressure toward a life without a sexual self. It is debatable whether you can live a healthy, normal life without a sense of sexual selfhood. The critical question is: when is the absence of a domain of selfhood a kind of pathology?
- What are some other examples of unnecessary domains of the self?
- The richness or impoverishment of the world depends upon the richness/impoverishment of the self. The world is only rich to the extent that we can distinguish and appreciate different beings, and our ability to distinguish and appreciate different beings is a skill that we develop via exploration and intervention. This skill (or family of skills) constitutes the self.

I'm starting to feel that the "multiple selves" model isn't the best description of our experience. While it is true that we don't always have the same self operating at any given time, this isn't true because there are multiple, clearly defined selves that persist over time and reappear when called for. Rather, there are loosely defined coalitions of need/skill models that compete for our self-attention. I'm currently failing to see any utility in calling these need/skill models selves. The self isn't a thing. It isn't simply a model. The self is the activity of drawing our attention (through exogenous or endogenous processes) to a collection of models that work in the moment.

Our needs are constantly shifting, and they don't always present themselves unambiguously. We are constantly engaged in retroactively determining our needs by satisfying them with skills that we deploy in a predictive, hypothetical fashion. Each deployment is a hypothesis, designed to simultaneously satisfy the need and also get feedback about whether we had a good model of the need we were trying to satisfy. This is how the motor system works. And this is how selfhood works, I'd argue.

We don't have memories until our models of our bodies and of the world are in place, allowing us to successfully predict (and therefore actually perceive) the dynamics of our bodies and the world.

"I don't feel like myself" --> My motivations, instincts, drives, desires, preferences, etc. are different from the model that I have of those things.

"I didn't act like myself" --> I failed at predicting my behavior because my model of my behavior was incorrect.

The self has a foreground and a background, just like the rest of our experience. The background is the collection of models that we have of our environment, of our bodies and their needs, the skills for meeting those needs, etc. The foreground is the coalition of models that are momentarily prioritized due to endogenous or exogenous deployment of attention to the current landscape of needs.

The background of the self is the corpus of models that we have of the various features of our organism and its behavior. What are some of these features that we try to model?

- What our body (especially our face) looks like, and how it differs from other people.
- How we move through space--i.e., the skills for satisfying our needs for movement.
- The sounds that our bodies produce (i.e., our voice, the way it sounds when we breathe, etc).

The need for individuation.

A self emerges only to the extent that we have a need to individuate our body from other things. Unpacking the term individuate: we have a need to model the boundaries, powers, limitations, and statistics of our individual bodies. Even the simplest organism, if it has something that constitutes a model of its "body" (i.e., the boundaries of the organism, how it moves, etc.), then it has a self. It doesn't necessarily mean that it is aware of the self, but it has something within it that is self-referential; it possesses information that picks out and reflects back on the organism itself. **At the simplest level, having a self means that the organism encodes information about the organism in a way that sets it apart from its environment.**

magnetosomes in bacteria ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetosome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetosome)). They are taking in information about the environment, and using it to find oxygen free water (which is more plentiful the farther north you go, I guess?). But you can fool the magnetosome with a magnet. This doesn't mean that the magnetosome (or the bacteria) is misrepresenting the source of oxygen free water. It means that the magnetosome is doing its job (i.e., to signal magnetic gradients). The sensor gives the bacteria information about the exterior world, and it is being used for a function that is completely independent of what the sensor itself is doing. There is no sense in which the bacteria models the relationship of its body (and its needs, like oxygen free water) to the world, such that it could discover errors in that representation.

A physical, material self emerges as we learn what we can control and predict--i.e., what the boundaries of our ability to intervene into the material world are. This is our material body; it only appears as we refine our skills for satisfying our needs to effectively orchestrate muscle activity (for solving other problems like moving, eating, crying, etc.). All these specific needs constitute a family of needs that are best described as a need to know what we can voluntarily control and what we cannot (in order to satisfy other more specific needs).

As social animals, we discover needs to individuate our body and behavior from that of other humans. Our survival depends on being able to keep track of the identity of allies and enemies, sources of comfort/resources and sources of pain/danger/competition. The human brain is hardwired (during healthy functioning) to tag social interactions with reward or aversion; social interaction intrinsically engages the systems that control fear, reward, bonding, etc.

Similar to the nested structure of action, and how we make sense of it. The skills we employ for satisfying needs are implemented within a hierarchical, nested structure of meaning. This means that the selfhood that relies upon those skills also exists within that same structure.

A self can be fabricated at will, in the moment, to solve a problem or meet a need. But it is being fabricated out of raw materials that stay the same, that are persistent over time, which allows us to retroactively link any current self to past selves. We can even revise the self on the fly if we mistakenly pulled out an ill-suited instance for the occasion. This makes it clear that selfhood is very much a dynamic action/perception loop. It isn’t some reified thing that is there for us to perceive. It is an activity (although not usually an intentional one) and the consequence of that activity, wrapped into one. Just like action and the consequence of that action (i.e., perception) are inseparable.

**What are the different kinds of selfhood?**

- **Body/World boundary:** Organism encodes information about the organism and environment in such a way that it possesses information about the boundary between them. This boundary can exist on multiple levels of specificity:
    - A boundary between the body and the world of physical things.
    - A boundary between the body and the world of other similar organisms.
- 
- 

**What is the most basic definition of selfhood?** The organism encodes information about the organism in a way that sets it apart from its environment.

**What is the nature of this information?** It is a model that tries to predict, separately, the behavior/physics of the organism, the behavior/physics of the external world, and how they interact.

**What do I mean by model?** I mean some mechanism (usually neural) that either (a) acts as a controller for mapping desired outcomes to movements, typically reinforced by reward, or (b) predicts outcomes, tracks the error in those predictions, and updates information in order to improve future predictions.

**A model of what?** Anything, really. As long as there are models of the organism and the environment (the only two possible kinds of models, I suppose), and these models are predicting phenomena that relate to one another (e.g., "the world makes a particular sound when I clap my hands together"), they can contribute to a setting of boundaries between the organism and its external environment.

**Why would a model be important?** It is the basis of long-term skilled behavior that is more than just a reflex, and it is the basis of short term adaptations of those skills in response to fluctuations in the physics of the environment or the organism. In other words, it is the foundation of flexible behavior that is adaptive at short scales. It is the foundation of our ability to learn beyond reflex and simple operant conditioning. With a reflex, there is an intrinsic pairing between stimulus and response. With conditioning, an external reward mediates learning an arbitrary pairing between stimulus and response. What does a model give us beyond this?

OLD IDEAS

selfhood ideas

The ability to construct a self is a dimension of selfhood. It is recursive. Here is the argument.

- We have skills for satisfying needs.
- The ways in which we explore and creatively discover the skills to satisfy these needs lead to individuation.
- In other words, the unique skills we develop to satisfy our needs (and even some of the unique needs we discover) are the building blocks of selfhood.
- Selfhood is an activity we engage in that is an interpretive response to the current set of needs, drawing upon the set of skills that we have developed. These skills are always in the background, and the skills that we are currently using constitute a sort of selfhood foreground.
- The experience of a cohesive, internally consistent self that persists over time (despite pretty radical changes at times) -- how does this arise? I argue that the persistence over time depends on the sense of access that we have relative to the corpus of need-skill models that we have developed over time. In other words, the background doesn't change all that much.
- When we start to fret about authenticity (i.e., whether our self is real or not), we enter a sort of hall of mirrors, where each step away from the activity of making sense of our self-making becomes something to also step away from. It is an infinite regress. Stopping and deciding that we are finally authentic--this only happens when we arbitrarily feel satisfied and artificially break the loop.

Why is it important to explore/honor your shadow? You'll always have a shadow (i.e., things driving your behavior that are not immediately accessible). There are some things in the shadow that, when you shine a light on them, they can be incorporated into the narrative of the self. For example, I might learn to accept certain darker features of my fantasy life, recategorizing them as features of myself, as ways of making sense of my behavior. And this can provide traction for any efforts to either emphasize or control that feature of the self. But there are other things in my shadow that, no matter how many times I see them, will escape any attempts at incorporating them into a narrative of the self in any helpful way.

An example of this is implicit bias. This can be trained out of someone by conditioning, but simply acknowledging that you are biased will not help you understand, in the moment, how to stop from being biased. The main difference is that there are, deep within the shadow, things that are there because they fundamentally operate at a level that is not accessible to cognitive functions, and there are things that are there because they are difficult to incorporate into our narrative of the self (e.g., because of shame).

1. Conscious vs Unconscious, controlled vs automatic.
    1. We are only aware of a small portion of what drives us.
    2. Example(s) of people being wrong about causes of their behaviors
2. Everyone has a shadow
    1. Definition: Shadow is all of the parts of yourself (or, rather, all the selves) that you don't present as yourself -- it is also the set of needs, drives, and motivations that you simply don't currently have conscious access to, for whatever reason. One of those reasons can be suppression, hiding due to social reasons, due to a lack of consistency with an autobiographical narrative.
    2. Comes from depth psychology (psychoanalysis), maybe a little bit of baggage. We don't necessarily need all of that baggage (e.g., id and ego, collective unconscious, etc)
    3. Basic account:
        1. We have a dominant narrative about our selves; a model.
        2. much of our conscious experience involves weaving our actions into a consistent harmony with that model. Most of our efforts here are successful because we've had lots of time to observe ourselves and model ourselves. Our models are usually mostly correct. Also, we are really good at reshaping our memory in order to make our behavior fit with our model.
        3. It is painful to confront an error signal -- i.e., evidence that our narrative is wrong; that we have drives and desires and historical facts about ourselves that are not consistent with our narrative.
            1. Much of this pain is social. We want people to see us in a certain way, and there are negative social repercussions for being different than what you portray yourself to be. This is because other people are modeling us in order to predict our behavior, and if they can't do that effectively (because we are not presenting an accurate self-portrayal to them), they can't trust us.
                1. This is a fascinating idea. Our brain is constantly modeling various features of our experience: our perceptual experience, our motor output, our body schema, etc. In almost every case, there is no deterrent to updating the model; there is no aversive experience associated with confronting the error signal. Indeed, the updating is largely mediated by the dopamine system, so there are rewarding/appetitive features of our model updating, in most cases. The one major exception seems to be the updating of our model of the self. We resist updating our model of the self, and doing so is almost invariably painful. Why this difference? Perhaps it is because in most cases, the model is designed to help us more effectively move our bodies, gain resources, exert power, etc. Evolution has made these inherently rewarding. But in the case of the self, it really seems like the cultivated self (the one we project to others and the one that is painful to change) is not simply a model that helps us gain rewards and resources (although it does do that) -- it is also a model that encourages others to trust us and work with us (probably because this resulted in better survival and more rewards during evolution). Having an inaccurate model will make others less likely to trust us, and changing our model is an admission that our model is capable of being wrong, and therefore, is less trustworthy. People who drastically change who they are force others to update their models; this introduces uncertainty into their models, and makes it harder to trust.
                2. Also, the error signals are more ambiguous! The error signals interact with our exquisite skill for distorting reality (and the error signal) in order to make it fit our model, rather than the other way around. This is a feature of models. How much they rely on the prior, and how much they rely on the posterior. The self as a model heavily biases toward the prior, shaping incoming information in order to fit it. In contrast, motor adaptation uses models that are very sensitive to the error signal, and are easily and rapidly updated. Are there invariant properties of models that make them more or less dependent on the prior vs the posterior? Develop a Bayesian account of the self! Maybe Konrad would be interested, if there was some way to actually test this?
                3. It is also painful because it requires lots of work to rearrange our narrative and figure out how to get it back to what we want it to be. Our self models are stubborn, perhaps because they are reinforced so often.
            2.
