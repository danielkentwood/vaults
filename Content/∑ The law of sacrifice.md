**Introduction**

Just for the sake of giving context to my remarks, I'll say that during my preparation for this message, I couldn't stop thinking about two fundamental aspects of our Stake service that could use some improvement: (1) our personal ministry through home and visiting teaching, and (2) our ward and branch councils. I don't want to give the wrong impression; there are amazing things happening throughout the Stake in both of these areas, and I want to acknowledge them. But there is surely room for improvement. We could talk about numbers. Statistics serve an incredibly important function, but I'm sure we've all had the experience of feeling like the numbers were becoming more important than the people they represent. So I'll simply say that the numbers, especially with respect to Home and Visiting teaching, are telling us something about who is (and who isn't) being ministered to within the Stake. On a similar note, the goal isn't to simply make sure we are all "doing our home teaching", but to be sure we are about the work of the Lord in ministering to and caring for and loving those who have been given to us. Brothers and Sisters, we all need to do a little bit better.

**Is the Gospel Changing Us?**

In the book of Alma, we learn that Alma was the Presiding High Priest for the Nephites during his time, and, as we learn in D&C 107, this means that he was also their prophet, like unto Moses. The Church went through a period of growth, with a flurry of missionary work. But then Alma noticed that, as he puts it, "the church began to fail in its progress' (Alma 4:10). We should all be familiar with what he did. He stepped away from the leadership of the civic government, which he was doing as a prophet at the time, and appointed a chief judge so that he could go out among his people and "bear down in pure testimony against them" (vs. 19). Have you ever wondered what he said to them? What was his pure testimony? Well, Alma chapter 5 is actually an excerpt from his testimony to them, and it mostly consists of a list of some of the most direct, soul-displaying questions that we find in scripture. If you think temple recommend interviews are hard, try sitting across from Alma during Alma chapter 5. I want to focus on just one of these questions:

"And now behold, I ask of you . . . have ye spiritually been born of God? Have ye received his image in your countenances? Have ye experienced this mighty change in your hearts?" (vs. 14).

He repeats it a few verses later:

"Can you look up, having the image of God engraven upon your countenances?"

I wanted to share these verses mostly because of a conversation I had with a friend recently. I asked him, "What, in your opinion, is the most essential ingredient when it comes to lasting change in our behaviour? We are constantly repenting for the same things over and over again. Is there one element that is most crucial in breaking this downward spiral?"

His answer: You have to have a life-changing experience that really shakes you.

I had to chew on that for a second. My initial impulse was to disagree; was to say that we don't need miracles and grand displays of heroics to change, we just quietly do our best and then wait for Christ to make up the difference, and by the time Christ has made up the difference, the change has already happened, and you can look back and now see the image of Christ in your countenance a little bit more, even though there was nothing incredibly drastic that happened. The more I thought about it, though, the more I realized that, even when this is a slow process, with the divine nature distilling upon our soul like the dews from heaven, there is still one ingredient that is always present at some point in the process: a broken heart.

Our hearts are set so much upon the things of this world. I like the word "set" here. I once broke my hand and had a cast with a metal mould for my ring and pinky finger, to keep them from moving. Well, one day I was having a pretend ninja battle with some girl at High School, and she wasn't very accurate with her kicks. She kicked the metal extension on the cast and bent my fingers backward. It didn't feel all that bad, so I bent the extension back into place, made a mental note to avoid that girl in the future, and thought nothing more of it. When I went to get my cast off, they did an X-ray to confirm that everything was healed. Of course, it wasn't. The hand had broken again and was starting to "set" improperly. So the doctor, without warning me, yanked on my fingers and mashed my hand, in an effort to re-set the bones properly. This was a dramatic experience.

Our hearts are set so much upon the things of this world, and they need to be broken before they can be re-set properly. When this happens, things get shaken up. It may not be anything that looks like much to the outsider, but inside we are going through our own private perfect storm.

Even Alma warns us that things will get crazy. Going back to verse 14: "Have ye received his image in your countenances? Have ye experienced this **mighty** change in your hearts?" And is there anyone here who thinks that having someone else's image "engraven" into our countenances, and not just anybody -- a God's image engraven into our countenances -- is there anyone here who thinks that this is going to be an entirely pleasant experience? Alma is talking about a life-changing, core-shaking experience.

Here is another way of asking Alma's question: "What is the impact of the Gospel upon your life?"

Isn't it heartbreakingly ironic that the Church provides us with a constant flow of experiences that are designed to break our hearts, and in response we become experts at avoiding those experiences, at not stepping up to them when they arrive, and then at night we pray that God will make us more like him and provide us with opportunities to grow. I can talk about this with some level of expertise because I am guilty of it.

Isn't it puzzling that we can come to church week after week seeking spiritual strength and healing, and then we don't recognize the offering of that healing because it doesn't come only in the shape of a sacrament tray, but also in the shape of someone who is sitting alone in a pew (and the impulse to go sit by them), or in the shape of an impromptu assignment or calling that means that you won't get to watch that episode of Honey Boo Boo on TLC or read the last chapter of your novel tonight, or in the shape of an empty chair at the ward council, or in the shape of a list of families that we haven't Home or Visit taught in the last few months, or in the shape of a particularly disruptive member of your sunday school class (and the impulse to continue loving them anyway), or in the shape of someone that has offended us badly enough that we would rather not attend certain meetings and instead set the rather poor example of lingering in the halls and foyer. If the sacrament doesn't break our hearts enough to do these things naturally, we are doing it wrong, and we probably need some help with the breaking.

We want the Gospel to enrich our lives, but we don't want it to interfere. Well, let me sum up Alma's pure testimony:

* There is no enrichment without interference.

* There is no edification or upbuilding without first breaking down and getting to the foundation.

* There is no resetting without first breaking.

* There is no lasting resemblance to God without a mighty change of heart.

**Ways to Break a Heart**

One of my all-time favourite songwriters is Ryan Adams, who is sometimes tragically confused with Bryan Adams. He has a song called, "Excuse me while I break my own heart tonight." I've listened to the lyrics many times, and have come to the conclusion that Mr Adams doesn't have anything really enlightening to say to me about how to break my own heart in a constructive way.

But it's a great question: Are we dependent upon external circumstances when it comes to being heartbroken, or can we break our own hearts?

One of the cities that Alma visited had a group of people that were particularly receptive to his message. These were poor people, and their hearts had been broken by the fact that they wanted so badly to worship in the temple, but the upper class had essentially banned them from doing so. Their intense desire to worship was intensified even more by the fact that they felt unable to do so, essentially creating a vacuum that sucked everything else from their hearts except this desire to be in that holy place. Alma commended them for their humility, but pointed out that they had been compelled to be humble, and tried to help them see how much better everything is if we can just cut to the chase and humble ourselves. So let's say that there are essentially two ways of breaking a heart.

1. Someone or something else breaks your heart.

2. You break your own heart.

The rest of the talk will be devoted to the process of breaking our own hearts.

Jeffrey R. Holland gave a good definition of the heart when he said that it is "the poetic location of our loyalties and our values". To slightly modify this, I like to think of the heart as a hierarchy of competing values.

How do you break something like this?

1. You deprive the heart of something it values highly.

2. You force it to do something it doesn't value highly.

These are two essential sacrifices that we make in our personal journey of discipleship. In the interest of time, I'll address just the first one.

**The sacrifice of relinquishing things we value.**

There are other names for this: fasting, abstinence, self-control, discipline, and one of my personal favourites -- simplification.

A few years ago my family went on a trip to visit Walden pond. This is the pond that Henry David Thoreau made famous by setting up a small cabin there, living an extremely sparse lifestyle, and keeping a beautifully rendered journal of everything that he experienced during that time. He had some interesting things to say about simplicity. Here is a taste:

"Our life is frittered away by detail. An honest man has hardly any need to count more than his ten fingers, or in extreme cases he may add his ten toes, and lump the rest. Simplicity, simplicity, simplicity! I say, let your affairs be as two or three, and not a hundred or a thousand; instead of a million count half a dozen, and keep your accounts on your thumb-nail."

And, in talking about the distractions of modern life, he said:

"Men think that it is essential that the Nation have commerce, and export ice, and talk through a telegraph, and ride thirty miles per hour, without a doubt, whether they do or not; but whether we should live like baboons or like men, is a little uncertain. If we do not get out sleepers, and forge rails, and devote days and nights to the work, but go to tinkering upon our lives to improve them, who will build the railroads? And if railroads are not built, how shall we get to Heaven in season? But if we stay at home and mind our business, who will want railroads? We do not ride on the railroad; it rides upon us."

He has an entertaining way of making the point, but I think there are some deeply meaningful principles embedded in these words. To what degree are our own lives frittered away by details? Are we so busy with the matters of life that we are not actually living our lives, but our lives are living us?

The Lord, speaking to Joseph Smith, said it a different way: "Sanctify yourselves that your minds become single to God" (D&C 88:67). This requires the purging of all the little frittering, dissipating details of our lives.

At the end of the day, can you reduce everything that you did to less than 5 things? Less than 4, or 3? God says we need to get it down to just one! In other words, at the end of the day, we would be able to say that everything we did that day had one purpose--the immortality and eternal life of God's children. That will mean that we will have figured out how to care for our body (eating, showering, etc) with that purpose, how to go to work with that purpose, how to relax and enjoy ourselves and unwind with that purpose in mind. On my best days, I think I'm still only able to reduce it down to 3 things: God, work, and family. Family and God should be easy to get together, and there are many times that I do, but if I'm honest with myself, I must admit that they become separate motivations for me on many occasions. On too many days I get pretty frittered by my details, though, and I'll get through the day and realize that I wasn't living that day--rather, there was a series of events, most of them pointless, that lived through me.

To bring this down to an even more basic and practical level, may I suggest an exercise?

Try to pretend that you don't know what your highest values and strongest desires are. Pretend that you are looking at yourself from the outside, trying to guess what your values are. Now, based only upon the amount of time that you devote to various activities throughout the day, what is the hierarchy of your values? What does your heart look like? Is it any different than what you previously assumed?

Now, what can we prune from that list?

Let's start with the obvious things. We are living in an exciting time when technology is forcefully inserting information into our lives at a suffocating rate. Our ability to develop new technologies is progressing much faster than our ability to consume them in a healthy way. As individuals and as a society, we are still infants in our ability to deal with the endless possibilities and instant access afforded by technology. So it is safe to say that most of us are spending too much time in front of a screen, whether that be a smartphone or a movie theatre screen. All I can say is "congratulations" to those who have mastered this (if you exist, please come talk to me afterward), "stay strong" to those who are already engaged in sacrificing a dependence upon media and technology, and "good luck" to those who haven't started. This will break your heart more than you know.

But everything on the list is a good thing! someone might say. Wonderful. It is one thing to give up something bad, which you should be giving up anyway. It is quite another to sacrifice something that you love that is good. As you give up the symbolic "firstlings of your flock, and first-fruits of your field," those heart-breaking sacrifices will have a lasting power and influence over your behaviour.

In the end, the most heart-breaking relinquishments will be those that involve core beliefs about ourselves. We may have to give up the belief that we are too shy to function in the calling we have been given. Another person may have to relinquish her death-grip upon the fact that she is above all other things a writer of fiction because her fanatic writing is displacing God or family (or both) from the center of her heart. Another may have to give up a grudge that he or she sadly and only recently realized has defined who he or she is for years now, even to the point of making it impossible to not attend services in one's own ward. We may have to give up the doggedly determined belief that no, I don't have a problem, no I am not addicted, no I can do this on my own. But we can give these things up. We can break our own hearts, whenever we are ready.

I have witnessed true courage as I have extended callings to people not because I felt that they had plenty of time and energy to fulfill the callings (in fact in most cases I felt completely the opposite), but because the calling came from a Father who knows them far better than I do myself. Often with tears, they have rounded their shoulders, taken a quick look at everything that they are going to have to either put on hold or give up completely, and then responded without hesitation: "Yes." Those are sacred times for me, they are scripture for me, just as moving to me as reading about a heart-broken widow placing her last mite into the hands of the Lord.

**Back to the point**

I started off my remarks talking about HT and VT and Ward Council. I hope it is clear that, even though I haven't really mentioned them in between, that I have been talking about them all along. I spoke mostly about breaking our own hearts by depriving them of things that are valuable to us. We would be better at these aspects of our personal and collective service if our lives were a little less cluttered with the values and goals that we passively inherit from our situation.

Again, the statistics on HT and VT in our Stake are indicative of certain deficits in our collective service. These deficits would not exist if we all understood the principle of sacrifice and a broken heart a little bit better than we currently do. And again, I don't like being as blunt and direct as I have been, but I am speaking to the leaders within the Stake, so you can take it, and I have confidence that you already understand the gratitude and, frankly, the humility that we as a Stake Presidency feel as we witness the incredible work that is already under way within the Stake.

**The Atonement**

I want to briefly connect all of this to the atonement. It may seem like an obvious question, but it is still worth asking: What does the Atonement have to do with breaking our own hearts by simplifying our lives? Again, the Lord said: "Sanctify yourselves that your minds become single to God" (D&C 88:67).

In a perverse sort of way, the desire to sanctify ourselves can become a selfish project. We can seek sanctification because it feels so grand to be sanctified. In fact, I believe this will happen by default in most cases unless we force ourselves to remember the example of Christ when he sanctified himself.

During the intercessory prayer (as found in John chapter 17), as Christ is praying to God and remarkably engaging in the process of Atonement for us even before he has carried out the great Sacrifice, he says something interesting about his own motives for sanctification.

"And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth."

In other words, Christ himself went through the heart-breaking process of relinquishing every desire, wish, hope, and hunger that wouldn't fit into a life entirely devoted to His Father. And he did it because of his love for us, not because he thought it would be great to be sanctified or even because he felt it was his duty.

As we seek to break our own hearts in the coming months and years, in an effort to simplify our lives and create a space where God can really make some lasting changes within us, it is my prayer that we will do it out of love for those around us: those at our dinner table at home, those in our neighbourhood, those in our congregations and classrooms. And that we will understand that it is only because he loved us first that we are able to love others and sanctify ourselves through that love.
