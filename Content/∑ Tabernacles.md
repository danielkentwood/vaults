# General Notes
parent:: [[the self]]

- Weave autobiographical stories into Tabernacles. Make it almost a memoir about how we are bundles of selves rather than a single self. Have sections that are pure autobiography. Then have a related science/philosophy section about how I've made sense of the world. [e.g., tell the story of trying to cast out the demon, or the story of having sleep paralysis]. This approach makes the larger point that my framework for understanding the world has been constructed, piece by piece, by the experiences I've had and the selves I've been. And that it is difficult, if not impossible, to evaluate a philosophical position without any information about the person who holds it.
    - Opening:
        - I'm a mormon boy who isn't a mormon. You might say that I have to be one or the other. I can't be both. Logically, 'x' and 'not x' cannot be true at the same time. But what are the ways in which this actually might be true? Well, first, it could be the case that I mean something different each time I use the word "mormon". It could be true, after all, that part of me still self-identifies as a mormon, even if I'm not officially a member anymore (which is actually true). Another way in which this could be true is that I have more than one self, and that one of them is a mormon and another is not (which, I will argue, is actually true--when I go back to visit church, a very specific set of skills and needs and attitudes automatically spring into action, even if they've been dormant for months or years).

How would you empirically test the idea that we have multiple parallel selves? Well, it is a theory that is opposed to the idea of a monolithic, linear, serial self. So one prediction is that there should be certain features of experience (e.g., needs, skills, emotions, perhaps even knowledge) that (1) are the key determinants of self-identity and (2) are not stable across contexts. It is one thing to have access to all skills but to appropriately use them conditionally according to the context. It is another thing to have reduced access to some skills based on the context. The trick is to find a metric that even the opponents of polyhexalogical theory would agree with. It might be the case that both the unitary model and the polyhexalogical model of the self are unfalsifiable, since it is hard to measure "access" to skills and knowledge.

It might be the case that it ultimately doesn't matter how we describe the self, as long as we recognize certain features of it. We don't always have access to the same set of features that typically define a self; these are dynamic over time and across contexts. Some people, including me, argue that talking about the self as a collection of selves better communicates that idea. Others aren't troubled by describing this phenomenon as happening within a unified monolithic self that relies upon context to bias certain skills and associations.

The need for a narrative self is not a monolithic need. We are all on a spectrum. For some people, this need is massive and crushing. For others, it is almost non-existent, and they aren't troubled by contradictions in their behavior. And the magnitude of the need isn't the only thing that varies. We vary in how we excavate the need by satisfying it with different kinds of skills. Some people end up satisfying the need for a self by matching a template, some people have skills for avoiding templates and individuating themselves, etc.

depression. One of the symptoms/byproducts of depression might be an increased inwardness, an increased sense of the self. Is there a biological account for this? Links to vigor/dopamine?

We don't have full control/ownership over our own actions. These are being driven by other needs/skills. But then, depending upon how strong our need for a clear, reified sense of self is, we have to weave those actions into a narrative in which we are the driving force. We have to take notice of all of our morally and socially salient actions, and find a way to make them ours without threatening the overarching narrative. Luckily, there is some stability in our skills, and unless there is fierce competition between them, or a change in the regime of dominant skills, we don't have to do too much work to fold our actions into our narrative (unless we have a really bad narrative).

The need to be the same person today as you were yesterday for other people to depend on you. This might be a big driver in the development of a need for a self. You're trying to become more predictable to others and to yourself. Others won't work with you and you won't receive the benefits of social interaction if you aren't dependable, and so it makes sense to model your own behavior, and try to make sense of it as deriving from an agent (your self) with causal powers, an agent who remains the same over time.

There is a clue in the way that we model other phenomena. The "god of the gaps" phenomenon is a clue into our need to predict behavior. If the behavior of a thing is unpredictable--whether that thing is a weather pattern, a geological or astronomical entity, a single cell organism, a rat, or a human--humans have historically assumed that there is an intelligent, complex, private being that is driving the behavior. Rats are pretty predictable, so we don't have to assume very much intelligence. The more complex a system is, the less we can predict its behavior, and the more we invoke a causal self behind the curtain. Gods have been responsible for the things we can't explain since the beginning of recorded history. The drivers of human behavior are so varied and complex and hidden from us. If we assume that the other person has a self that is driving this complex behavior, does it help us predict the behavior in some way (e.g., it biases us toward assuming that the person will be self-interested?), or does it simply help us reduce anxiety about not understanding the behavior?

The ability to promise depends on knowing yourself, and a degree of uncertainty. Promises aren't necessary if there is certainty on both sides. But there isn't. So the ability to promise is a measure of how confident you are that you will be the same person tomorrow that you are today.

The notion of acceptance of yourself, and what are the skills for doing that? It is a skill for reorganizing your narrative. Some people are better at this. Perhaps they even incorporate it into their own narrative, this ability to reorganize the narrative. In other words, some people pride themselves on redefining their lives.

What is the role of stress hormones in driving our attempts to solve the problem of the self? If you artificially increase stress hormones, it doesn't artificially increase the burden of the self, and yet you'll likely see escape behavior (i.e., addictive or compulsive behaviors like you see in rats who are stressed). On the other hand, there is nothing else you could do to solve the problem of higher stress levels (if they are artificially induced). You couldn't solve it by practicing radical acceptance, because there is nothing in that moment that needs acceptance, unless you confabulate a cause of the stress and rely on global satisfaction of needs to momentarily rid yourself of the stress. **There is an indeterminate relationship between biological signs of an unhealthy self and an actual unhealthy self. An unhealthy self always results in stress. However, increased stress doesn't always mean there is an unhealthy self. Similarly, activities that effectively address the unhealthy self always reduce stress (perhaps regardless of the source of the stress, even if momentarily, due to global satisfaction). However, activities that reduce stress don't always effectively address the unhealthy self.**

Stress is a measurable physiological response, a somatic marker that something in the body is imbalanced. When the imbalance is not at the level of psychology, it can be caused by things like sleep deprivation, malnutrition, physical trauma, etc. When the imbalance is of a psychological nature, it can be caused by pressure to do something you don't want to do, by fear, etc. It can also be caused by a fractured self.

Many people who suffer symptoms of ADHD could simply be dealing with a case of massive anxiety, which they've learned to manage by engaging in distracting, highly engaging, and highly salient activities. To what extent are we able to persistently engage in activities that aren't interesting to us, or that are difficult for us? What happens? We become alone with our anxiety, and it can be pretty uncomfortable. It would be incredibly fascinating to track, in real time, measures of anxiety (e.g., continuous cortisol readings [see [this link](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-13684-7)], galvanic skin response, etc.) and see if it is possible to predict when someone will switch from a difficult, boring task to a task that is more distracting and soothing.

How do we know we are anxious, stressed, etc. due to an unhealthy self? Does the experience have a particular flavor? Is it different than being stressed due to fear, for example? Do we often misinterpret it because we haven't developed skills for satisfying the need for a healthy self?

The kierkegaardian notion of anxiety as a problem of the fractured self, an incoherent and unattainable need to actualize infinite possibilities.

After developing your account of the self, talk about the various ways in which different **religions** manage the burden of the self. How different **therapeutic approaches** manage the burden of the self.





Basic principle: There is something wrong with your brain. To the extent that we behave in unhealthy, socially transgressive ways, our brains are not ideal.

But note that this is true only if healthy brains do not engage in socially transgressive behaviours. Is there any good reason to think that they don't? Well, it is a continuum. At one end, we have behaviours that are clearly designated as pathological -- i.e., far enough deviated from the norm that it is justifiable to try and treat them with therapy in order to return them to functioning within the acceptable margins of the norm. At the other end are the most common behaviours of all, which may or may not be socially transgressive, since our moral sentiments and legal landscapes don't necessarily coincide with our actual behaviours. For example, if the majority of the earth's population suddenly, overnight, became raging kleptomaniacs, we might try to correct their behaviour and bring it back to something resembling our shared sentiments about right and honest behaviour, but it would be hard to argue that these people -- the majority of the earth's population -- have something wrong with their brains. Their sheer numbers have actually yanked the norm back in their direction, so it is actually more normal to have a predilection for stealing.

So the question is:

Do our ideas about what constitutes brain pathology come from the statistics of the population or from our moral sentiments? After all, the majority of us may have a particular belief about what is right and healthy behavior, but may secretly have desires and even act on desires that violate that belief.

Have a section that highlights the helpful aspects of mindfulness, meditation, psychotherapy (especially CBT), and the four steps.

If satisfaction is indeed global, and this fact has facilitated our flight from reality by allowing us to self-medicate by way of an addiction or some other engrossing and unhealthy activity, then we can turn this phenomenon on its head and begin satisfying our unhealthy cravings and urges with a healthy satisfaction of some other concomitant need. The result of this is the body's reinterpretation of the negative urge.

Akrasia is universal. It is not a pathological state. ainslie claims that it is probably adaptive.

Alternate title: how the flesh becomes Word. (a play on "Word became flesh".) Maybe this could be a chapter title. Flesh Becomes Word.

* 1 thessalonians 5:23 And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. (If the body is evil, how could it be preserved blameless?)

**A body of scripture**

Different people are convinced by different kinds of evidence. All it takes is a visit to the comment section on seemingly any article or Youtube video to witness the rapid digression of discourse into incommensurable assertions of different kinds of evidence for opposing views. This usually takes the form of one person quoting scripture, while the other is quoting Richard Dawkins. When it is possible to martial both scripture and Dawkins, so to speak, in favor of your argument, your argument becomes more accessible and more convincing.

In this spirit, I want to use the scriptures to argue against one of the most common takeaways from the scriptures: that is, that the human body contains within it the seeds of evil behavior. That the flesh is weak. That our purpose in mortality is to transcend the base needs and desires that the body conjures up.




For some, all religions are guilty, to various degrees, of both (1) not adapting their old-fashioned, even archaic practices and ways of thinking, and (2) not staying true to their roots by aligning the contours of their practices and ways of thinking with the pressures of a secular culture. For some, all religions are necessarily both too rigid and too flimsy in ways that invalidate them as a whole rather than point to opportunities for improvement. And this is because, for some, there are clear benefits to living in a world where organized religion is an a priori evil. Et cetera for political parties.

Our actions are generated from a particular understanding of our situation, but our understanding of the situation is generated from our actions in past, similar situations. It is well to say that all of our actions spring from our thoughts, but it is vital that we also add: all of our thoughts spring from our actions (including perception under the definition of action). If we hope to change our behaviour, it isn't enough to put pressure on one little side of the circle; we must maintain a concerted pressure on all points of the hermeneutic circle.

Individual memories are little skills. We get better and better at re-building the events. Magically, declarative memory gets more and more clear as we rehearse it more frequently, as if we are uncovering an etching of what happened. Rather, we are gradually "edifying" the memory -- gradually building it from the ground up, adding details that seem consistent with the gist of the memory. It is like the memory is going through a growing and pruning process until it hits just the right size and richness, when the telling of it seems to have the desired effect most consistently.

As Jacob 3 implies, there is certain kind of "firmness of mind" required for the experience of love. This is because love is a behaviour that reaches beyond knowledge and certainty; it is a commitment in the face of uncertainty, and it is antithetical to the type of flexible, noncommittal approach of one who is governed by the rule of good faith and certainty, rather than faith and commitment. This firmness of mind involves a willingness to close oneself off to certain types of evidence -- it is an unabashedly biased and unbalanced filtering of what one is prepared to believe about the beloved. And this way of thinking is incompatible with a behavioural code that would have all of our beliefs and actions based upon nothing but a balanced, unbiased survey of the evidence.


From wikipedia article on apraxia:

Ideomotor apraxia: These patients have deficits in their ability to plan or complete motor actions that rely on semantic memory. They are able to explain how to perform an action, but unable to "imagine" or act out a movement such as "pretend to brush your teeth" or "pucker as though you bit into a sour lemon." However, when the ability to perform an action automatically when cued remains intact, this is known as automatic-voluntary dissociation. For example, they may not be able to pick up a phone when asked to do so, but can perform the action without thinking when the phone rings.

This automatic-voluntary dissociation has interesting implications for how we conceptualize skill-development. 

1. We clearly have a subsystem dedicated to learning complex, semantically laden sequences of movements in such a way that we don't have to voluntary represent to ourselves or anyone else what those movements are or what the goal that is driving them happens to be. 
2. We have a system that allows us to verbally represent the sequence of movements and their goal/purpose. 
3. We have a system that allows us to mimic or pantomime the sequence of movements and their goal/purpose.
