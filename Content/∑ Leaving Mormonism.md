### Why I left the Mormon church

I suddenly started valuing my status in the church less than the alignment of my public self with my private self.

It wasn’t about a sudden shift in belief. I hadn’t been able to believe in God for years. I had known about the “true” history of the church for quite a while. It was a shift in what I was willing to say out loud to other people about my beliefs. It was a sudden impatience with having to hide myself and construct explanations and apologies.

To be totally honest, my beliefs have shifted far more rapidly after leaving church than they did in the time leading up to my decision to leave.

If I didn’t believe back then, why did I not feel betrayed by the church, as I do now? That is, why do I feel so betrayed now, when I haven’t really learned anything new or drastically changed my beliefs? Perhaps it is because I have no incentives left to NOT be angry about some of things that I already knew. And that is scary.

If anything, my experience in the church (and, I believe, the experience of others) is a testament to the human capacity for constructing meaning and committing wholeheartedly to that meaning. It’s beautiful. I mean, on the one hand, it is a bit scary and depressing that I devoted my life to something that I now believe is a fiction. But on the other hand, it is beautiful to behold the capacity of the human brain for constructing completely new realities.

It is really easy to get used to lying. Just as it is easy to get used to grueling physical labor. If we do it long enough, it becomes, psychologically, a part of our reality, and there are costs associated with perturbing our sense of reality. But behind the scenes, underneath the sense of momentum that drives us to maintain the status quo even if it is killing us, we are developing a desperate hunger for honesty and transparency. And if we’re brave enough to face ourselves, excavate that need, and give ourselves a taste of that honesty? It diminishes that universal existential burden of having to maintain the self. It lops off a considerable portion of the concerns that we have to weave together into a coherent narrative about ourselves as good people.

This is why it is so important for us to be honest about what we believe? Not just about what we are willing to say, but what we are hiding, too. I used to discount belief. I used to ask, “Why does God care so much about what we believe? Isn’t belief only important to the degree that it moves us to act in a particular way? Well, if we act in that way without belief, what is the difference?” Perhaps I discounted belief because I wasn’t being honest with myself about what I believed; because my commitments were at odds with my beliefs. But now that I’m doing all that I can to align my life with my beliefs (or my best impression of my beliefs, since I’m not sure it is an easy thing to discern what you believe), my life feels lighter, simpler, and more efficient.

Telling the truth requires possession of the truth, or at least a stable impression of the truth. I think we have less of this than we think, but we still do our best when we don’t have it. When we have a stable impression of the truth, we don’t need to use memory of what we’ve said about something in the past. We can just look at the thing and describe it as we see it, with no need to store what we say for the future, because either (1) we trust that the thing will stay the same and we can just look at it again and describe it, or (2) we don’t believe there will be any negative consequences if we say something different about it next time. If we perceive that there are stakes involved with being consistent in our description, and we don’t trust that the phenomenon will be as we’ve described it in the past, we need to employ memory, and we start weaving a narrative to prop up this memory. The more narratives we have to keep track of, the harder and more exhausting it is. This is why lying is costly. It increases the processing burden on our brain, increasing stress and anxiety.

The Mormon practice of bearing testimony is a dangerously effective psychological dive into self-deception. From early childhood, members are taught to use the language of certainty. They are taught to look for an ill-defined feeling that signals a divine confirmation that some aspect of the church is true (e.g., the book of mormon, the prophetic role of joseph smith and/or the current prophet, the reality of the atonement and resurrection of Jesus Christ, etc.), and they are taught that identifying that feeling as having come from God is grounds for absolute certainty. They are taught to say, “I know.”

>This whole account of the self that I’m developing is closer to art than it is to science. Phenomenology always has been closer to art than to philosophy or science, despite its lofty beginnings as an attempt to ground philosophy on a foundation of descriptions free from conceptual presuppositions. Phenomenology is not in the game of establishing truth. It is in the game of providing good descriptions, and the way to evaluate whether the description is good or not is simply to ask, “Does this help me and a bunch of other people make sense of our experience?”

### Mourning Mormonism: How to be an apostate

Don’t do the 13 articles of faith there. It will be too long. Maybe point to them (which means you’ll have to do them in advance) or just update it with a link once they are done. Also, for the 13 articles of faith, don’t do them all in one big article. Rather, do them one by one so you can focus a bit more on each one and not lose the interest of the reader. Then have a “master article” that describes the overarching project and links to each individual article.


### Mourning Mormonism: Mormonism and the self

Mormon doctrine has some fascinating philosophical implications for an account of the self.

- Agentive theory, and the general approach of Warner/Packard.
- How selfhood is tied to family membership, marriage, etc.
- Selfhood and gender/sexual minorities. See [this link](https://assets2.hrc.org/files/assets/resources/HRC-2992_MORMON_Guide_SINGLE.pdf?_ga=2.170137568.1511866457.1532035005-1172724056.1532035005).
- Sexual development in general. The extreme, unnecessary shame that comes from teachings about masturbation and pornography. Sexual roles. There is a narrative in the church that pornography consumption is a slippery slope toward promiscuity/adultery at the most benign, and sexual deviancy/perversion/violence at the worst. This mostly relies on the self reports of people who try to make sense of their behavior and retroactively point to pornography. The science behind this is still developing. It is hard to actually have a controlled, ethical experiment that will settle this question. It isn’t a huge leap to argue that a great deal of pornography introduces many consumers to new modes of sexual interaction, many of them at or beyond the margins of what would be considered safe, consensual sex. It isn’t a leap to argue that most pornography objectifies the human body (primarily that of women) in ways that are not conducive to healthy sexual attitudes. However, it is important to think about pornography and how it intersects with the natural exploration of sexual fantasy. To the degree that pornography facilitates that exploration, it is potentially a good thing. To the degree that it creates and normalizes nonconsensual sexual violence (again, overwhelmingly against women), it is potentially harmful to ethical sexual functioning. More importantly, to the degree that it is heavily propped up by sexual slavery and the exploitation of disadvantaged demographics, it is a net negative in our moral landscape. Still, the problems with pornography cannot be discussed fairly without acknowledging that not all people who consume are drawn to sexual violence. It isn’t a slippery slope toward violence unless people already have the disposition (because of who knows what— culture, genetics, early childhood experiences, etc) to be drawn to that sort of thing. People who are drawn to it and who then make the inference that it is something to act out on without the consent of the sexual partner are guilty of conflating fantasy with reality. It is one thing to have a sexual fantasy that is taboo (because it is illegal, disgusting, immoral, etc.). It is quite another thing to act out on that taboo. Sexuality in general, arguably, has roots in our sense of disgust. It is done in private for a reason. We must also acknowledge the potential evolutionary roots of sexual violence (both in men and women as givers and receivers of that violence), and how it can be an important part of some people’s consensual sexual fantasy.
- Gender roles. Women and men.
- The burdens on the self imposed by Mormonism. The expectation of certainty can be a burden on the self. Shame.
- The mormon drive for self-improvement, self-mastery, and eternal progression. Contrast this with the universal drive to eliminate the self (at least the heavy parts), and how that is uniquely expressed in Mormonism.

### Mourning Mormonism: On leaving the Church alone

“They can leave the church, but they can’t leave it alone,” said in an aggressive, mocking tone. The underlying message is that people who leave the church still know, deep down, that the LDS church is god’s true church, and the only way they can feel good about leaving it is to attack it, providing a retroactive justification of their weakness and lack of faith.

The tragically ironic truth is that the vast majority of the ex-mormons I meet are people who have been deeply wounded and traumatized by their experience in the church. Being a mormon is such an all-encompassing project that Mormonism seems to seep its way into every cell in your body. It is not an easy religion to leave.

When someone hurts you deeply, you might immediately feel the impulse to forgive them. You may even tell them that you forgive them. But in that moment, what you do not have access to is the deeper layers of trauma that will eventually rise to the surface, days and weeks and years later. In those moments, you will have forced upon you the decision of whether or not you can forgive this person again. And again. And again, until the trauma has been fully integrated into who you are and there is nothing left to forgive.

This is what it is like to leave the LDS faith. To the extent that someone has been hurt by their experience in the church, they will be haunted until they can make peace with it. And they can’t make peace with it unless and until they see and recognize it. And this takes time. Sometimes it takes therapy. Sometimes it requires taking a stand and telling people what happened, and how it was wrong.

We wonder why ex-mormons attack the church and/or try to undermine the faith of others. But Mormons are taught to share, aggressively, the things that are most important to them with their friends.

**How to talk to ex-mormons**

- Don’t assume that they have lost their way, that they are confused, mentally ill, etc.
- Don’t assume that they left the Church so that they could sin without feeling guilt, or that they had already sinned and didn’t want to repent.
- Don’t tell them they are ruining the lives of their children, spouse, etc.
- Don’t testify to them about your beliefs and expect them to remain silent about theirs.
- Don’t tell them satan is motivating them to leave.
- Don’t assume they are leaving because they believe they are smarter than God (over-intellectual).
- No true scotsman. Don’t assume they left because they never had a real testimony in the first place. This fallacy is rampant in how the faithful define apostasy. For example, 1 John 2:19 “They went out from us, but they were not *really* of us; for if they had been of us, they would have remained with us; but *they went out,* so that it would be shown that they all are not of us.” In other words, those who apostatize demonstrate that their faith was never real in the first place.

### On certainty in Mormonism

The pros and cons of certainty, as it is found in Mormon culture. An abundance of options (like what is found in secular society) pushes us toward uncertainty. If that secular society also develops an understanding of our psychological biases and the limits of our knowledge, it becomes difficult to see certainty about religious and cultural ideas as anything other than a sin. It is okay to fully commit to a religion or a culture, as long as one recognizes these limitations and recognizes that uncertainty is the only rational and moral response to them.

### Divorce

Should I have an article about the divorce? I should I just keep it private? If I talk about it, how can I do so without throwing Kristen under the bus?

Don’t say anything about it on Facebook. It is tacky. Maybe send out an email to close friends and relatives?

resolution: don’t write about it in a “newsflash” format. If you write about it, make sure you’re using it to make sense of something else. Are you so needy, unstable, and dependent on the opinion of others that you have to divulge private details about your personal life as a way of vindicating yourself amidst the ambiguity that other people are experiencing about your situation?

If people don’t know you well enough to either (a) refrain from assuming that you are a bad person because of your recent choices, or (b) ask for clarification and discussion, then you probably don’t need to know or care what they think about you.

This is an essay about my exit from Mormonism. I tried to write it for people who know me really well and are invested in my happiness, and also for people who don't know me but are perhaps struggling with issues similar to what I experienced. It's long. It probably isn't always clear. I express a little bit of anger and confusion, and a lot of joy and clarity. I engage with topics that some people will find sensitive (e.g., sexuality, drugs, but sadly no rock and roll). I am posting this on social media with a bit of apprehension. I welcome both negative and positive reactions to this, but I ask that the discussion be civil.

I'm a Mormon boy. I was raised as a Mormon in a loving family, with Mormon roots extending back through my genealogical tree to the beginnings of this young American religion. I was baptized by my father in a frigid pool in my grandparents' backyard. As a teenager, I received the priesthood and felt a sacred weight upon me as I used it to bless and pass the sacrament during church meetings. During my high school years, while camping and exploring with my best friends in King's Canyon or the Sierra Nevada range, we would discuss the mysteries of god, and often pray and sing hymns among the quiet pines and cold, whispering streams of winter runoff. I spent two life-changing years teaching people about God and Mormonism in the Dominican Republic, northern Utah, and southern Wyoming. I came back and trained missionaries at the missionary training center. I went to Brigham Young University and met the girl I would later marry in the temple. I attended the temple, prayed, and studied the scriptures regularly throughout my adult life. I was (and am) constantly making mistakes, but I strived to stay true to the covenants I made. I served in many leadership positions: for example, a high priest group leader, a stake high councilor, and a counselor in a stake presidency. I loved working with and serving my fellow church members. I felt an overflowing love for them and from them, and that love inspired me to be a better man.

Throughout my life, I have had varying levels of certainty that God exists and that I was part of his kingdom on earth. That certainty peaked during my 2-year mission, started tapering gradually, and then dropped sharply in my late twenties. For more than a decade (I'm 39 now), I've been an agnostic flying below the radar in a church where spiritual certainty is essentially a prerequisite for participation. This decade happened to coincide with some of my most demanding church service, during which I regularly taught about God, testified of the divinity of Jesus Christ, and privately counseled with members seeking spiritual guidance. Why would I do this? At the time, I hadn't accepted that my lack of belief was something more than just a temporary stage of skepticism. I had invested far too much in the church and in my identity as a mormon and a disciple of Christ to just throw it away at the first sign of struggle. So I dealt with it in the way that we, as Mormons, are told to deal with it: I doubted my doubts, I doubled down on my commitment, I testified more vigorously and passionately (following the LDS mantra that "a testimony is to be found in the bearing of it"), I tried to focus on the things I did believe. But all of my efforts were self-defeating, producing an ironic awareness of how hard I was trying to be something that I wasn't. To make matters worse, I suspected that I was significantly motivated by a narcissistic desire to be perceived as someone who believed, and that this motivation grew stronger the less I believed. But I simply couldn't get myself back to believing in a god. Stepping into the spotlight and testifying didn't magically produce a testimony; it only illuminated the gap between who I was and the man people thought I was.

To anyone who felt strengthened and inspired by my words during this time, I hope you don't feel that this confession changes what you felt. The fact that I was aspiring to know by claiming to know has no bearing on what you feel and know. I am sorry if you feel betrayed. I know that part of me feels betrayed by my duplicity, so I don't blame you.

Why did I stay in the church so long if I didn't even believe in a god? I already mentioned how I viewed my skepticism as possibly temporary, and how I viewed my massive personal investment into the church as a sunk cost. But there are other reasons. At the top of that list were the people in my life. I couldn't bear the thought of disappointing my father or dishonoring my deceased mother by discarding the covenants that were supposed to hold our family together throughout the eternities. Those same covenants were foundational in my marriage, which I didn't want to disrupt. When my daughter arrived on the scene, I felt an obligation to be the righteous and faithful father that I was taught all children deserve. I felt the weight of the expectations of my family and friends. The social network that pushes you forward in Mormonism is immensely powerful, and in hindsight, it looks to me like it does a much larger proportion of the work in motivating faithfulness than I previously thought.

I also stayed because I felt like the church community needed voices like mine.

**Why I finally left**

I'm still a Mormon boy, through and through, but I am no longer a member of the LDS church. I was excommunicated because, strictly speaking, I am committing adultery. I know that is one hell of a bomb to drop, especially for old friends who only knew me in my youth, for people who have known me only in the capacity of church service, and (especially) for extended family members who may not know the details about my recent life. As jarring as it is to hear, please keep reading, because it isn't exactly what it sounds like. For now, I'll just say that I personally initiated and cooperated with the church discipline process, and I fully support the right of the church to administer the consequences of violating a set of rules that I voluntarily agreed to observe earlier in my life. While there are several things about the disciplinary council process that I could complain about, I mostly feel love for the people who were in that room with me. I have sat on the other side of the table during disciplinary councils, so I know enough to say that they were doing what they thought was best for me. It ended with hugs, not anger.

At the time, a few people asked me why I was submitting to the formal discipline process, essentially allowing them to label me as an apostate and stamping a narrative on my life that I obviously don't agree with. Why volunteer for a dishonorable discharge when you have the option of just walking away? I had no intention of changing, so why didn't I simply resign from the church? Well, it's complex. I didn't want to be excommunicated. I would have preferred to remain a member of the church, among my friends, and continue to build on what I had in common with them. At the same time, I knew that my choices were serious violations in the eyes of the church, so there was little chance that I could keep my membership intact. But for some reason it felt imperative to allow the church to make this decision about my membership. By honoring their process, I hope I made it as clear as possible that I wanted to stay and have a voice. In the end, I wanted there to be one final act of respect toward the church that I gave so much to, and that gave so much to me. So I was perfectly happy to hear their official position on my choices. It provided a sense of closure for me that voluntary resignation may not have provided.

I don't think adultery is good. It is bad. I just don't agree with the church that what I'm currently doing should be considered adultery.

I've spent the last few weeks reading dozens of essays titled "Why I left Mormonism", or some variant of that title. I've noticed a few things. First, each person's voice is unique. Sometimes there is pain and anger in that voice. Sometimes there is regret and apology. Sometimes there is joy and freedom. Sometimes a mix of all of the above. Second, I was struck by how similar many of their experiences are. Most of them identified a sense of betrayal and confusion over finding out about certain dark events and chapters in the LDS church's history that haven't exactly been preached over the pulpit over the years. They left because they couldn't reconcile two images of the church: a clean, streamlined image that was taught to them in lessons and talks and essays from the church leadership, and a darker, messier image that the church has only recently, and quietly, acknowledged. Third, I noticed that most of these essays were written by people who were already writers. That is, they already had a web presence (e.g., a blog) where they wrote on other topics regularly. I'm not sure what to make of this, but it does make me wonder about the actual practice of writing such an essay. Plenty of people quietly walk away from the church. No fanfare necessary. What is motivating the people who are writing these essays?

So here we are. I'm at my desk, writing a letter to my friends and family about how I am no longer a member of the LDS church. And I can't exactly put my finger on why I'm writing it. Plenty of people quietly walk away from the church. But for me, saying something feels necessary. I truly hesitate to compare this experience with that of queer people who come out of the closet in a public way, because being a Mormon involves receiving almost none of the oppression and bigotry and intolerance that keeps so many queer people in the closet, but my experience feels similar to theirs in at least this one respect -- I have been hiding from myself and others for a long time because I want people in my life to like me and think highly of me, and I'm afraid they won't if they know the truth. And this fear kept me in the closet for well over a decade. So finally having the courage to be honest does feel a little like a celebration, and a little like a betrayal, and a little like an embodied non-sequitur. All of these invite explanation, and maybe a visible announcement like this is something that will ameliorate the frankly exhausting process of rehearsing this explanation to everyone I know individually. Maybe it's just that I'm a writer, and writers gonna write. And maybe, perversely, the courage to do this can't feel like courage unless I display it in front of people and invite their judgment, positive or negative. Among my better sentiments is the hope that someone else who is in the same position that I have been in might be comforted by my words.

Somewhere in the mélange of emotions and motivations driving me to write this, it feels like there is this implicit assumption that most people who know me are on the edge of their seats, dying to know more about the changes in my life that are most likely apparent only to me and to the people I'm closest to. It is an uncomfortably selfish thought among other selfish thoughts, but I suppose that is appropriate. Many of my recent decisions have been hounded by a looming accusation, usually but not always self-generated, that I'm being selfish. Selfish for parting ways with the religion I was raised in. Selfish for walking away from my marriage. Selfish for dating and finding love again before the divorce is final.

And, when it comes down to it, the answer to that accusation is sometimes: yes, this might feel a bit selfish, but the alternative has usually been inauthenticity. You don't have to be selfish in order to be authentic, but maybe a bit of selfishness is common when you have an awakening to parts of yourself that you've been suppressing. During significant self-discovery, there can be a tiny love affair that happens with the self, an infatuation with this emerging person that feels more powerful, more free, more me. This intoxication is something to keep an eye on during the honeymoon phase with your shiny new self. But, of course, this is precisely part of the reason why it is good to doggedly chase down and murder all of your instincts to hide who you are. It feels so healthy and liberating to finally accept your most firmly rooted features, and to finally feel that exhilarating sense of creative discovery of who you've been all along. You can't intentionally change yourself unless you see yourself, and it is hard to see yourself clearly when you're running away from your reflection.

More importantly, you can't really do a good job connecting with other people when you're fleeing from yourself. Your interactions are shot through with hedges and second-guessing and little barbed reminders that what you just said wasn't how you actually feel, and often you find yourself whiplashed by a full-fledged self-betrayal. That specter haunts the space between you and the people who love you and think they know you. So, it is at least a little comforting that my experience so far has lined up with my expectation that accepting some hard truths about myself might feel selfish as I view my actions through certain people's eyes, but it has also made me more present, less self-absorbed, more attentive, and more loving when I am with people. I feel seen, and as a result, it is easier to focus on seeing others.

**Things I still love about mormonism:**

- The atonement.
    - In mormonism, the atonement is an act and a process. It is the act wherein Jesus suffered the consequences of our sin for us, because it is something that we do not have the capacity to do ourselves, and even if we did, it isn't clear that after our suffering we'd be justified in entering the presence of God. It is a process in the sense that Jesus still mediates between us and God when we come to him and follow him; he is still pleading our case by pointing to what he suffered for our sakes, calling forth mercy for us not because we've earned it, but because he has. While I don't have very much evidence that the act of the atonement happened, or that Jesus is alive and actively trying to bridge the gap between us and God, I firmly believe that the ideas embedded in this narrative are some of the most powerful ideas available to humanity. The idea that we can effectively call forth positive change in the world by performing acts of self-sacrifice in behalf of an individual or a group -- the idea that some of the most defining characteristics of humans are their capacity for empathy, for mercy, for love, and that these capacities rise to the surface when we witness acts of selfless love, breaking cycles of violence and discord, and bringing people into fellowship and harmony -- if any ideas have the power to save, this is one.
- The music
    - I love the hymns of the church. They'll always be imprinted on my heart. Maybe more than anything else, they remind me of what it feels like to possess the certainty that god exists, that he's your father, and that he loves you.
- The people
    - Most of my best friends are still Mormon. In my experience, the majority of them are trying their absolute best to be good people, to be honest and authentic and wise, to engage with and build their community in positive ways, to share the most precious things they possess with their friends but only in a way that doesn't impose on or alienate their friends. Mormons love knowledge and wisdom, and revere education. They value self-improvement. They take great care of their bodies, for the most part. They are bold, courageous, and unyielding, for better or worse, but mostly for better. While I currently disagree with much in the current doctrinal and cultural landscape of Mormonism, I have great faith in the individual people, and I have hope that they will push the church in the right direction as it continues to evolve.
- The principles of welfare and self-reliance
    - Mormons value self-reliance so highly that they famously keep an emergency supply of goods in case of an apocalypse (zombie or rapture-related). The potato pearls are actually quite delicious, and they'll keep for probably close to a century. This emphasis on self-reliance is integral to the welfare approach of the LDS church. Local leaders who allocate resources to people in need are trained to do so with an eye toward enabling those people to become self-reliant. There are no handouts in the church, strictly speaking. People are asked to do whatever they can to "qualify" for the assistance, and this often takes the shape of little acts of service like cleaning the chapel on a Saturday, or providing a ride to church on Sundays for other members who lack transportation. Coupled with this is a surprisingly effective range of employment resources that educate and provide members with new opportunities. The end result is a powerful safety net that empowers and lifts instead of creating dependency. I love it.
- The rituals
- How much it demands from you.
    - Any cause that's worth being a part of will demand more from you than you want to give. Mormonism demands a great deal.
- 

Can we have a frank discussion about some of the things I don't like about mormonism?

**Things I don't particularly like about mormonism:**

- A cynical and combative view toward non-members
    - Members of the LDS church are faced with the challenge of reconciling two very different ways of seeing and talking about non-members. They are the enemy, and they potentially future members.
    - We don't hear church leaders explicitly saying that non-members are the enemy, but we certainly hear lots of talks that imply as much. For example, that we must be on our guard.
- Corporate structure and culture.
    - The church still struggles with the paradox of its own growth. Paradoxical because the more it becomes a managerial institution that explicitly or implicitly encourages hierarchies (i.e., unsurprisingly, white, wealthy, educated, married men with children are at the top), it necessarily results in members who feel not quite at home, who feel lesser. God bless you if you are an unmarried minority woman over 30 who is active in the church. In an effort to standardize the experience of mormonism across cultures, the church has adopted solutions that risk it becoming the very thing that Jesus fought against -- powerful institutions that are concerned with public relations, accumulation of resources (always in the name of wisdom and prudence), top-down imposition of hedging rules and practices and proto-commandments in order to establish easy definitions of who is worthy and who isn't, etc. Jesus hated such institutions, and sought to protect the most vulnerable from the powerful who judged and excluded them.
    - Many people who leave the church complain about the history of the church. Yes, the leaders of the LDS church have done some bad things, and have convinced lots of people to also do and believe bad things. And yes, the church hasn't been totally up front about its own history. It hasn't bothered me as much as it bothers other people, and has played almost no role in my divergence from the church. I'm more concerned about what the church is right now, and I chalk up its hesitancy to talk frankly about its past (to all members, not only those who are curious and educated enough to read auxiliary literature and academic discussions about it) to a victory of the corporate mentality. More specifically, a victory of branding, PR, and cynicism ("It is more important that people are enticed to join the church, and they won't join the church if we give them the messy details.") over honesty and transparency. This can happen in big institutions without anybody explicitly espousing such values. You just create a PR department and it does its job by crafting the narrative to be as inviting as possible. It is the antithesis of their job to give the whole, messy story. And slowly, imperceptibly, the PR story becomes cleaner and cleaner, and the more it is repeated, the easier it is to forget that it is a massive simplification. Regardless, the truth is out there now, whether the church likes it or not, so this is becoming less and less of an issue.
- Women are not treated as equals.
    - I understand the argument that men and women have different roles, priesthood for men and child-bearing for women. It doesn't sit well with me at all. First of all, not all women can bear children. Furthermore, to hold the priesthood is to have unique opportunities for service and leadership. There isn't any reason, in my view, why only men should have those opportunities. There is a really great reason, on the other hand, why men don't have the opportunity to bear children--it's because their biology doesn't allow it. The "different roles" argument fits a little too comfortably among much other evidence that men, generally speaking, have always feared the sexual/reproductive power of women, and this fear is expressed everywhere, from our humor ("I don't trust anything that bleeds for 3 days and doesn't die."), our lexicon of possible words to describe someone who has sex out of wedlock (and how it is overwhelmingly dominated by words that only apply to women), our workplace policies and practices (we ask women to cover themselves so that we don't have to control ourselves, and we somehow think it is unfair for a woman to ask for more leave than a few weeks after bearing a child), and our roles in religious communities.
    - Women are not treated equally when it comes to discipline. Men are given harsher consequences for their actions, presumably because they hold the priesthood and are therefore more accountable, but for a church that so effectively teaches the relationship between agency/knowledge and accountability, there seems to be scarce recognition that holding women to a lower standard of accountability belies an assumption that they lack agency and/or knowledge. To the degree that this happens (and it happens all the time), it is a massive insult to women.
    - Heavenly mother. On the one hand, I love the fact that we are the only christian religion that believes in a goddess as well as a god. But golly gee willikers do we mess it up when we start talking about why we never talk about her. When the early church leaders started talking about a mother in heaven, I don't know if they foresaw the immense power that existed in the idea that we have a Goddess. One of the most salient features of mormon doctrine over the last few decades is the emphasis on the family. The proclamation to the world clearly outlines the roles of men and women, and hints at the idea that these roles are eternal. The rearing of children is primarily a maternal responsibility. Why doesn't it strike us as odd that our mother plays absolutely no role in our development as divine beings? Does she not love us? The answer that we usually get to this question is that God holds her in such high esteem and doesn't want her to be subjected to the same irreverence and mockery that he suffers at the hands of his children. She is too sacred and special to him to be subjected to it. But wait, we're talking about a Goddess, right? A divine, perfected being. Presumably she is strong enough to handle anything that he can handle. Why is god the father controlling the access that we have to our mother, and that she has to us? Because she needs protecting? Does God infantilize our heavenly mother the same way the women of our church are infantilized?
- The doctrine that binary gender is part of eternal identity, and that the only acceptable romantic love is love between a man and a woman.
    - I don't feel like I have to explain this very deeply. It's the doctrine that ties the hands of church leadership and members when it comes to fully accepting the humanity of sexual and gender minorities (i.e. queer people). For the vast majority of active members in my generation (at least in my social circles), this is a deeply painful and uncomfortable topic because they actually do accept the humanity of their queer friends and family, but can't fully talk about it within a church context.
- The attitudes about sexuality.
    - Specifically the attitudes about sexuality that make it permissible for grown men in positions of power to ask 14-year old girls if and how they masturbate, that place adultery/unmarried sex next to murder in the rankings of sin, that drive so many members (especially women) to feel dirty or guilty when they confront their sexuality, that completely ignore/denigrate sexual compatibility between two people as a possible factor in the decision to marry (for eternity) and start a family, that create an environment where people feel that they must leave their spouse if he/she views pornography, that simultaneously elevates sex as a creative power to a sacred status but then denies that it is a feature of personal identity and a form of loving expression unless it is heteronormative.
    - There is something I like about the idea that sex is holy. But taken too far, it becomes a denial of our desire and a repudiation of the importance of fantasy, a diminishment of physical touch in the hierarchy of loving expression. It puts sex on a pedestal so high that it feels like God is paying lots of attention to how you're expressing your sexuality. Unfortunately, part of the whole point of sexuality is to drop inhibitions, be fully exposed and vulnerable in front of our partner, engaging in the give-and-take of trusting and disclosing desires and fantasies, exploring new desires, and feeling accepted and loved in all of our awkwardness and weirdness and darkness. It is not easy to be forthcoming with our hidden desires when God is watching and ranking your sexuality on a scale of sinfulness. So, yes, let's call sex holy. But only to the extent that it doesn't exist on a continuum of sin and righteousness. It is beyond that. It is a revelation to another person of our capacity for sin and our righteousness. Of course, I'm not saying that anything goes during sex. Consent (including full capacity for consent) and the equality of desires for all involved parties are the only arbiters of wrong and right when it comes to sex. Violations of these are criminal at worst, and just bad, solipsistic sex (i.e., using someone as a tool to masturbate) at best. Ironically, lots of masturbation masquerades as "fair play" in mormonism because it happens to involve another human body in the bed.
    - In mormonism, I often heard the notion that sexuality is something that belongs to your spouse. You are not to engage it. Only your spouse has the keys to your sexual engine, and it is up to him/her to turn that key, not you. This is said with good intentions, usually to help men avoid masturbation, pornography, and infidelity. But it ends up casting sexuality as a thing to be afraid of and ashamed of. It is a "river of fire" that must be hedged up and walled off on every front, lest it consume us completely. This is not a healthy view of sex.
    - Some members may escape the more vicious side-effects of these attitudes. I didn't. With a bit of hindsight, I see that I was what I can only describe as sexually anemic. There was no vulnerability in my sexuality, beyond being naked. It makes me pretty sad, and I don't wish it on anyone.

**Things that I believe, that may or may not overlap with mormonism:**

Here are some things I believe. Some of my own "articles of faith."

- *We should take full responsibility not only for our moral actions, but also for our moral beliefs.*
    - Ethics are mostly concerned with external systems of rules for conduct. Morals are personal beliefs or habits or motivations regarding what is right or wrong. Following an ethical code requires definition and validation from someone other than oneself. Following a moral sentiment requires only internal definition and validation. We can (and certainly do) inherit our moral sentiments from our interactions with other people. But we should strive to have a moral position on most, if not all, of the ethical rules that govern our lives.
    - One thing I learned from mormonism is the inseparability of agency and responsibility.
    - It is difficult, although not impossible, to take ownership over (and responsibility for) what you believe to be right and wrong. Often, the moral agency you exercise amounts to a series of decisions of whether to abide by a moral framework that was given to you. Your accountability is limited to whether or not you did a good job adhering to the framework. But if the framework is flawed, do you take some of the blame for that? Or is it the fault of God or the church?
    - When it comes to moral and ethical questions, I've somewhat lost my ability to believe in a solid foundation (like God) to base my beliefs on. I still believe it is imperative to have strong beliefs, but I am more inclined these days to value a self-generated commitment and loyalty to a set of beliefs over a sense of certainty that one's particular set of beliefs is true or demonstrably better than another set of beliefs. In other words, adhering to your moral code is more important than where you got it from. Be consistent and invested. Be partial. Be biased. But always be aware that by doing so, you are cutting yourself off from other possibilities, which is sort of the entire point.
- *Epistemological humility is an underrated virtue.*
    - Epistemological humility is a recognition that you don't have access to the truth, generally, and more specifically, you don't have any more access to the truth than anyone else. It does not necessarily involve a belief that all truth is relative--it can also be experienced by people who believe in absolute truth, but then it requires the belief that none of us are privileged in our access to truth, such that it is impossible to verify who possesses the absolute truth.  **
- *"Ought" is more important than "is".*
    - This risks being a self-contradiction. Saying that ethics is more important than metaphysics sounds like a metaphysical claim. That's not what I'm doing here, though. Regardless of what does or doesn't exist, ethics is more useful than metaphysics.
- *There are countless ways of being good.*
    - What do they all have in common?
    - 1 Thessalonians 5:21 says, "Prove all things; hold fast that which is good."
- *Honor the darkness in you.*
    - By darkness, I don't necessarily mean evil. I mean the parts of you that you want to hide or that you thin the world should hide, for whatever reason.
    - We are products of an evolutionary process that rewarded the fiercest competitors, the craftiest manipulators, the most magnetic and charismatic leaders. There is a great capacity for darkness in us. Out of all creatures in the animal kingdom, we are the most adept at deception and dishonesty. Perhaps because of this, efforts to suppress the darker parts of our nature often feed that darkness. Rather than denying that it exists or trying to keep a lid on it, find healthy ways of expressing it. Art is, and always has been, an ideal outlet for our darkness. It allows us to express it so it doesn't hurt us, but we are releasing it into a fantasy world rather than a real world. Certain features of religion do this really well--e.g., the focus of an entire religion on the universe's need for immense suffering in order to balance the evil that humans create, the celebration of the willing submission of an innocent god to cruel torture and abandonment. These themes honor the darkness in us. Some religions do it better than others. Catholicism's notion of original sin, for example, is an acknowledgement of our capacity for darkness. The polar, back-to-back festivals of mardis gras and lent celebrate our need to express our appetites and darker drives, to give in to our flesh, so to speak, in order to have a chance at learning to control it.
    - None of this is endorsing sin. Darkness and sin are not synonyms here. Rather, I'm endorsing an acceptance of all of you, not just the parts that look and feel good. There can be no light without darkness. We cannot know abundance without knowing scarcity. There can be no meaning without absurdity. There can be no joy or pleasure without sorrow or pain. Don't turn away from the darkness, the absurdity, the sorrow, and the pain of the world. And definitely don't flee from your own. Face it down. Accept it. Embrace it all, and life becomes solid and rich.
- *Faith and impartiality are opposite ends of a spectrum, and we should try to find balance between them.*
    - “Man’s value does not consist in either an explosive, maniac sincerity or an unquestioned faith. Instead, it consists of a higher awareness which enables him to determine the moment when it is reasonable to take things on trust and the moment when questioning is in order, to combine faith and good faith within himself” (Merleau-Ponty, “Faith and Good Faith” 179).
    - "If sincerity is one’s highest value, one will never become fully committed to anything, not to a Church or to a party, not to a love or a friendship, not even to a particular task; for commitment always assumes that one’s affirmation surpasses one’s knowledge, that one believes by hearsay, that one gives up the rule of sincerity for that of responsibility” (Ibid 179).
    - “Never absolutely good or absolutely bad, man cannot be sincere, for sincerity supposes a definite nature which one can assess without ambiguity. It is a matter not of contemplating oneself but of constructing and going beyond oneself” (Ibid 176).
- 

Many of my recent choices were driven by a thirst for expansion. I wanted to expand the range of experiences available to me, to gather more data so that I can make more informed decisions about what I think is good and bad. As part of this process, I have made friends with people I never would have met if I hadn't tried to expand. Most of these people live in the more urban parts of Chicago, have few or no children, and are generally not religious.

* Higher value placed on spending time with friends, even for people with children.

* Higher value placed on celebration.

When someone throws out the bathwater, it is an awfully low bar to hope that they don't throw out the baby, too. Only monsters throw out babies. We should also hope that they actually get better at not letting the baby get so dirty in the first place.

In my case, accepting myself meant that I had to accept and embrace my recalcitrant agnosticism. For basically my entire adult life, hearing and, in some cases, uttering assertions that

I want to sustain all of my friends and family who are still in the church. I want to listen to them testify. I want to hear their experiences of prayer, of revelation. I want to hear who they are, and I love who they are, undiluted.

Two worlds with clashing values. Different languages. Different language games.

I have found many words that have come to straddle these two worlds. Just to give two examples here: intoxication and sexuality.

From an etymological perspective, the word 'intoxication' has mostly negative connotations. It is a state of being affected by toxins. When we're talking about things we ingest, it turns out to be pretty hard to draw a clear line between what is toxic and what isn't. After all, the human body is a realm of delicate balances and gradients of chemicals. Any substance, at the right amount, will be toxic to this system.

This is a love letter to Mormonism. It is also a farewell to Mormonism. I'm writing it because I want to tell my family, my friends, and my community how I make sense of the events that led to me leaving the church.

I was raised as a Mormon, in a family with a Mormon heritage going back multiple generations on both sides. I can't imagine having a better family, both immediate and extended. My father was and is one of my most consistent models of what it means to be a good person. My mother was a figurative, and is now a literal, angel. So many of the ideals I absorbed from them -- e.g., love, adventure, creation, faith, unity, kindness, self-reliance -- so many of these were expressed in the language and the framework of Mormonism.

It is a bit ironic that many of the ideals that were instilled in me through my experiences in the Church were precisely the ones that led me out of it.

Navigating both worlds. A secular world and a religious world. An urban and a suburban world.

There is a difference between having reasons to leave and having no reasons to stay. There are still reasons for me to stay in Mormonism, although they have dwindled over the years. Here are some of the reasons for me to stay:

- **Family**. I love my parents and want them to be proud of me, and I want to share a common language and culture with them. My mother having passed away only seems to have amplified this feeling, which I didn't expect. She died with a particular image of me (as a faithful disciple of Christ), and I suppose it just might be the nature of some maternal relationships that you don't want to change that image -- it feels like you're leaving behind the version of yourself that your mother loved, and maybe her along with it. And then there is my father, who has always felt like a dad, a best friend, a teacher, a therapist, and a role model, all rolled into one awesome man. Part of me knew that he would love me no matter what, but part of me knows how deeply and passionately he has given his heart to God, so there is bound to be disappointment. This primal need to model myself after my parents was one of the strongest motivators for staying in the Church.
- **Friends**. The majority of my best friends are active Mormons. I don't want there to be a rift between me and them because of my decision to leave.
- 

When it comes to reasons to leave, there weren't very many things pushing me out.

When you talk to people who have recently left the Mormon church, there are often common threads between them.

- Treatment of LGBTQIA community.
- Historical matters
    - Inconsistencies in history (e.g., how Joseph translated the plates)
    - Dark events in mormon history (e.g., Joseph and underaged brides, racism)
    - How the church has (mis)handled its own history
- Negative experiences with a priesthood leader

I've been disturbed by all of the above, but I honestly can't point to these as my primary reasons for leaving Mormonism. In my most hopeful moments, I saw them as growing pains in an evolving culture and institution. For example, I hoped that the Church would adequately address and make amends for its historically appalling treatment of the LGBTQIA community, and that it would reverse more recent policy decisions that punish the children of openly queer people. I still hold on to that hope.

I won't say much about the end of my marriage. I'll only say that it involved the most painful experiences of my life so far, followed by the most difficult decision of my life. It is hard to not tell a story here. I want to be seen as a good man, and I know how this situation looks. But one of the most valuable lessons that I'm learning from all of this is that true moral security only comes when you don't need others to validate your decisions in order to feel confident in them.

The people who were holding my hand the hardest throughout the ordeal know how

Why did I leave?

* I can't bring myself to believe that there is a God.

* I became convinced that there are countless ways to be good. Mormonism is just one of those ways. I yearned to experience other ways of being good.

* I wanted to experience new things. I wanted to see the world through different eyes.

**A distaste for metaphysics**

In James 1:27, it says, “Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, *and* to keep himself unspotted from the world.”

During my mission, I suffered from a few serious health issues. When I arrived at the MTC, I started noticing some sharp pain in my lower back and down the back of my left leg. It started to impact my ability to sit or stand for long periods of time, so I went to the medical clinic. After a quick examination, the MTC doctor looked at me gravely and said, "Young man, you have a long and painful life ahead of you." I don't know about a long life, but the painful part of his prophecy was rapidly fulfilled as I started work as a missionary in the Dominican Republic. I tried multiple cocktails of oral and injectable drugs, postural support devices (basically, a girdle), and no small amount of fasting and prayer and promising God that I would be better, that I would work harder if he would just heal me so I could do the job he called me to do.

Gradually, inevitably, my condition deteriorated until I could no longer move my left leg forward or lower my head to look downward. I was dragging my leg behind me as I wandered the streets of Villa Gonzalez, in love with God and everyone around me, and immersed in the very real certainty that my pain was purifying me and elevating my service into a more sacred space. It was both exhilarating and confounding. I would swing wildly between severe depression and ecstatic absorption into my role as a messenger from God. I had already witnessed the grey palette of depression in my teenage years, and had learned to cope with it through writing. So I wrote. I wrote about God. I wrote about the psychology of missionaries and of the people in the D.R. who I wanted to love God like I loved him. I delved into the mysteries of ancient scripture, unlocking hidden messages and linking common threads and patterns in writings from very different people from very different cultures at very different times.

I could only manage to fall asleep on the concrete floor of our barren flat. I started to dread sleep, both the painful effort of falling asleep and the excruciating shock of waking up and trying to move my body. Using my bike became impossible. It took me more than a minute to stand up from a chair after an appointment. The mission president had seen enough, and reassigned me to the mission office, where I did secretarial work in a less physically demanding environment, and where I could be more closely monitored by the mission nurse.

I studied philosophy as an undergrad at BYU. Kept telling people that I would never leave the church because of it. I wouldn't be one of those guys.

I've started writing a lot of books in my life. Finished none of them so far. About 10 years ago, I had an idea: what if I could describe the experience of spirituality (specifically, within Mormonism) purely from the point of view of the body? What is the phenomenology of prayer? The physiognomy of transcendence? The corporeal correlates of faith? In spite of the striking materialistic threads in Mormonism (e.g., everything is matter, and matter can't be created, just reorganized), we speak of our spiritual experiences as if they are happening outside of, or in spite of, our bodies.

At any given moment, there is an LDS missionary sitting across from someone, telling them that the physical body is like a glove, and our spirits are like the hands that go in the gloves, with the unmissable implication that our bodies are shells. On the one hand, the science fiction and fantasy geek in me loves the idea of humans as luminous and pure beings puppeteering doppelgangish golems of dumb, chaotic flesh. On the other hand, it's bad metaphysics that runs contrary to the best parts of mormon doctrine. On the third hand (sorry, I'm envisioning a mutant with three hands), I think it's just a really bad description of our experience.

So my goal is to encourage us to describe our experience of faith in ways that don't need to appeal to faith itself.

faith is not simply a list of propositions with which you agree. I may not have had the ability to believe in God, but didn't mean that I couldn't exercise faith. Faith is, first and foremost, a filter that you willingly or unwillingly place between you and the information available to you. In the absence of compelling information about how you should interpret the world, it is a commitment to a particular interpretation of the world.

DISCIPLINARY COUNCIL

I am here because I've chosen to act in ways that run contrary to the commandments of God and the covenants I made with God. Specifically, I've chosen to disobey the Law of Chastity. More specifically, I am in a committed, long-term relationship with a woman to whom I'm not married, and there is an intimate dimension to our relationship. In a legal sense, I am also committing adultery because the divorce between myself and my separated wife still hasn't been finalized. And despite all that I have been taught, I can't bring myself to believe that I am doing something wrong. I know how this sounds.

I made this decision with full awareness of how it would impact my standing in the church. It is not a decision that I made lightly, and it comes after more than a decade of consideration. During that time, I couldn't say with any degree of confidence that I believed in God. I did everything I was supposed to do. I felt a consolation and a gratitude for wisdom when I studied the scriptures, but I could never get myself to see them as inspired by a divine being. I felt an emptiness whenever I prayed, and felt silly, like I was talking to myself, but I kept praying anyway. When I was asked to serve in difficult leadership positions, I accepted without hesitation, even though I felt like an impostor every time I tried to testify and strengthen people's faith in a God that I didn't know and couldn't find. I served an honorable mission. I married in the temple and loved my wife. I came from a strong tradition of faithful members. I tried to find reasons to doubt my doubts. I planted all the right seeds, but they never blossomed into the kind of faith and certainty that other people seemed to have, and that I knew I needed in order to feel morally secure in the church.

One of the things that helped me last so long in this state was my belief, which I still hold, that the code of conduct expected by the church in the form of commandments and covenants, is almost entirely a good one, independent of what happens after we die. I think fasting and abstinence are principles that are under-appreciated and misunderstood in many places outside of the church. I like the Word of Wisdom's emphasis on being good stewards over our bodies, even if I don't agree with some of the specifics. I think the law of consecration is beautiful, and the program of fast offerings is one of the best implementations of social welfare and wealth redistribution that I've ever seen. And the example of Christ is something that I continue to aspire to.

There are also doctrines that I find beautiful, even if I can't say whether they are true or not: the doctrine of vicarious covenant-making; the doctrine that God will save essentially all of his children in a kingdom of glory unless they proactively fight against him; the doctrine that we have a heavenly mother, even if we don't talk about her enough; the doctrine that we are co-eternal with God. I don't believe these doctrines are true, and I don't believe they are false. I don't have any way of knowing. But I find them beautiful and admirable regardless of their truth value.

This is how I have approached religion and religious experience for some time now as an agnostic.

There are two ways of being untrue to yourself in the gospel. First, you can believe in the gospel, but act as if you don't. Second, you can lack belief in the gospel, but act as if you have that belief. These are obviously different kinds of self-betrayal, but I do believe they are both clear acts of self-betrayal. I don't know where we inherited that idea -- that if you don't believe something that there is great social pressure to believe, it is okay to just pretend that you believe, especially if it is in the service of preserving the image of an ideal family, or any other image, really.

But not believing and acting like you don’t believe is really not an option if you want to remain a member of the church. So it becomes a matter of how much you want to be a member of the church. Is it more important to you than aligning the self you experience and the self you present to others? I guess for this is why, for most of my adult life, I've consistently acted as if I have a belief. There have been so many compelling reasons for me to to do this.

But over the last two years, I have had a series of experiences that taught me how to develop and trust my own moral compass. These experiences revealed a version of myself that I have been searching for. I don't feel like I have to hide, or lie, or pretend to be someone that I'm not. I can be honest about the ways in which my moral instincts diverge from the gospel.

So this isn’t about me leaving a church which I believe to be false. I’d very much love to remain a part of the church. It’s about me feeling compelled to explore other ways toward truth, other ways of being good. And since I’ve made this change, my life has become so much more simple and happy and meaningful. I feel like I am more myself than I’ve ever been.

Thank and express love.

1 Thessalonians 5:21Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.

In our church, there is massive emphasis placed on "finding out for ourselves," but we sometimes make it hard for people to have an authentic experience of discovery. If someone goes to god and asks, what is our response if they get an answer we don't like?

**Fornication is good, and driving cars is bad.**

Driving should be considered more sinful than unprotected sex outside of marriage.

Murder is bad because you are taking a life. Fornication is bad because you are risking creating life outside of a family. Every time you drive, you are risking taking a life -- and you are weighing that risk against the inconvenience of slower but safer forms of transportation.

If I lose control of my car and kill someone, there are a range of possible contexts that influence how people judge the morality of my loss of control. If I was drag racing on a busy street or driving while drunk, people will judge me harshly. If it was a momentary lapse in concentration and I didn't notice someone merging, and then overcorrected, people will not blame me for the death that occurred, and may in fact feel sorry for me. But the fact remains that when I stepped into the car, there was already a well-established statistical likelihood of me doing exactly what I did, and if I had walked instead, or even rode my bike, that likelihood would have approached zero.

It's also odd to compare murder and fornication because murder is the actual consummation of an evil intent resulting in the loss of life, while consensual fornication is usually the consummation of a passionate love at best, a selfish indulgence at worst; but at the extremes and everywhere in between, fornication is the act that increases the chances of accidentally bringing a life into the world.

It is common to find a response to this sort of thinking that goes like this: the only reason why he's arguing this is because he wants to justify his own (future or current) fornication. I mean, maybe, I guess? But we are all anxious to be seen as good, to varying degrees. A similarly overconstrained response to this way of thinking could go like this: the only reason why you are arguing against my position is because you want to justify your own brand of sexual morality.

In talking about bringing life into the world, what do you think matters more -- whether the couple is married, or whether they are good people?

Consider two couples. One is married, and they are abusive and neglectful, and they fight with each other all the time. Another is not married, but they are good people who love and are committed to each other, and respectful to other people. If it is morally wrong for one of these couples to bring life into the world, which one is it?

If you say that a couple cannot be good if they are not married, then this is precisely the type of thinking that makes me uneasy. It defines good and evil not by the behavior of the individual, or the kind of person they are, but by their participation in an institution (in this case, one that is sanctioned and regulated by the government).

---

Some members of the church do not feel comfortable questioning statements, decisions, and policies made by church leaders, present and past. Some feel comfortable doing so because they still comport in alignment with the behaviors expected by the church, even if they don't feel that this is a morally sound position to be in.

At any given time, the church has a well-established set of doctrines, principles, and practices. These have evolved and shifted in emphasis over the years, but the church as an institution is unique in its ability to clearly communicate, in simple terms, what it believes God expects from us in the present moment.

For any of these principles:

I can agree with it and act in obedience.

I can agree with it and act in disobedience.

I can disagree with it and act in obedience.

I can disagree with it and act in disobedience.

Some specific things that I disagree with:

- **Monolithic and problematic view of how to validate spiritual experiences.**
- **Monopoly on truth/authority.** Similar, but different from the previous point.
- **Approach to sexuality.** The way that the church approaches some issues around sexuality is, in my view, harmful. For the church, sexuality is a fundamental, eternal aspect of our identity as sons and daughters of God, destined to be like him. In other words, it is a binary classification that This culminates in a view where sex cannot be understood as entirely good outside of the context of a sealed family.
- For me, personally, my experience of sexuality while I was actively living the commandments was so tied up with shame and inhibition and boundaries that it stunted the expression of vulnerability. Sex can and should be an experience that breaks down walls between two people, but the experience actually ended up driving a wedge between myself and my wife. I hope it is different for most other people in the church, but this is how it was for me, and I know I'm not alone.

This is not me leaving the church. I would very much like to remain aligned with the church, despite the . I may not agree with or like what is happening right now, but I respect the church as a whole, and more importantly, I respect all of you. That is why I am choosing to cooperate with this. That is why I voluntarily initiated the chain of events that I knew would lead to this.

I don't perceive myself as being unfaithful to my wife in anything other than the most accidental/technical/legal sense. It is not my belief that the morality of my choices is determined by the timeline of when multiple parties are able to get their schedules and preferences aligned to facilitate the stamping of a piece of paper.

    5. Sex as a way to explore the shadow, where there is no self, no narrative, no making sense of things, no reasons, etc.
3. Sexuality in Mormonism
    1. Mormonism embraces sex as a drive and sex as a tool, but rejects any model of sexuality that grants any privileged status to the self.
        1. It rejects the biological spectrum of sexuality (preferences, orientations, etc.) as saying anything important about the identity/selfhood of the individual.
        2. It regards with suspicion any form of hedonic pleasure, defaulting to the position that it is selfish in essence, and that all selfishness is evil.
        3. It denies that there is any essential dark part of us. Its theology holds that we are made of light, and that darkness is a temporary and avoidable feature of mortality. This invites prescriptions to avoid confronting or dwelling on the darker parts of our nature.
    2. The sin next to murder: Sexual sin in Mormonism.
        1. What makes something a sexual sin? Two types of answer. (1) God said so, and (2) God's reasoning for saying so. Granting that Mormonism holds that God has said that certain types of sexual behaviors are sinful, I'll try to focus on traditional LDS attempts to provide insight into God's reasons for regarding so much of our sexual experience as sinful.
            1. Masturbation
                1. 
            2. Pornography
                1. Watching it destroy friends and family. Not because of what the pornography was doing to them, but because of the shame they felt for doing it, and not feeling capable of stopping.
                2. Feeling addicted myself. The incredibly salient sense of compulsion and forgetfulness. Coming out to my ex-wife, early on. Fearing that I would ruin my life and my family. Irrationally, I contemplated genital mutilation and even suicide as solutions to the problem.

            3. Fornication
                1. Story of being involved in WAIT as a teenager. I think my mother was equally concerned for their physical and spiritual well-being.
                2. Story of being asked to not sleep in the same building as my girlfriend.
                3. Being shamed and almost denied the opportunity to marry in the temple because I got too excited while making out with my fiancé.
            4. Adultery
                1. Being excommunicated for adultery, even though I had been separated for over a year and had been working toward divorce the whole time.
