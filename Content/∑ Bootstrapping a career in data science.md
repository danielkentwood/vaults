Most people would wait until they landed a job before writing and publishing an article about how to land a job. The type of people who don't wait either don't know that most people don't want to hear advice from someone who clearly needs it, or they don't care, and I'm not sure which is worse. Which, in a way, makes things embarrassing for me. Because (yes, you guessed it) I'm about to write and publish an article about how to land a job in data science before I have actually landed a job in data science. But let me assert that (1) I do know and (2) I do care that you don't want to hear my advice at this point. So my job in the next paragraph is to convince you that you actually do want to hear my advice if you fall into one of the following categories:

- You are transitioning into data science from a different career.
- You are transitioning into data science from academia.

Here is where I convince you. First, this is not like other "how to land a job in data science" articles. If most articles are like recipes, think of this article as a meditation on why we sometimes get stuck endlessly accumulating recipes. I'm going to discuss the psychology of the problems that hound people in our position, and I don't need to be a seasoned data scientist to say something about it. Second, there is a recursive element to this article; one of the things I'll talk about is how important it is *to simply start making stuff.* This article is me saying something before it is comfortable to say it, and even if you disagree with everything I say, I hope it inspires you to be vulnerable and put content out there before you feel ready. Write this article yourself, and do it better. Third, I'm not going to give you answers. Again, other people are better positioned to do that. I can offer you questions. 

### On Transitioning

After a postdoctoral fellowship in neuroscience, I left academia for a scientific consulting job in early 2019. I was doing mostly litigation support as a human factors consultant. In essence, my job was to analyze accidents from the perspective of how the human brain interacts with the environment. It was fascinating work and I liked my co-workers, but I missed working with data at a deep level, and the culture of corporate consulting was not a great fit for me and my family. This was clear to me pretty early on, so I've been using my free time to dip my toe into the data science waters for a while. And now I'm parting ways with corporate consulting and diving head first into data science.

I am 41 years old. I've got a 9 year old daughter and a 3 week old son. A career transition now, during the height of COVID, is daunting. I am intimidated. But I'm also aware that there are many people in a similar situation. Locked in a job that isn't working. Fascinated by data science as a profession, and convinced that they have a knack for it. Desperate to somehow find the time to make progress toward a full-time position in data science while balancing their current job and family obligations. 

### Question: Why is getting a job in data science hard?

Hiring people is inherently risky. The interview process is noisy, injected with several unique sources of bias and error. A good candidate is one that is not risky. There are other considerations like cultural fit, ability to communicate, leadership potential, etc. But if you come across as risky in the fundamentals, nothing else matters.

To get a better sense of the unique risk of hiring a data scientist, think about why there are so many articles about how to get into data science. Here are two guesses: (1) writing articles is a way to market oneself in a hyper-competitive (almost manic) market, and (2) data science is still an ill-defined field composed of physicists, computer scientists, mathematicians, economists, chemists, biologists, MBAs, etc., who are engaged in a heterogenous bag of tasks like predicting churn, recommending products, building language models, developing object-detection algorithms for automated vehicles, scraping websites, performing experiments, classifying patients, computing loan default risk, ad infinitum. Professional fields like law or medicine have a clearly defined pipeline for developing and signaling expertise. Data science is such a rapidly evolving field that it may resist such a training pipeline for many years to come. Perhaps when data science matures to the point that it fragments into more clearly defined roles, it will be easier for everyone to know who is ready to be hired and who is not. Until then, your job is to communicate to your interviewers that you are not a risky hire. 

For the company hiring you, "low risk" means that you (1) communicate clear evidence that you already have the toolset and the temperament to add value in your role, and/or (2) you have most of the tools and temperament AND you communicate clear evidence that you are capable of rapidly acquiring the rest. 

### **Question: What information will you commit to?**

If you're like me, you have read close to a hundred articles on how to land a job in data science. Most of these will tell you to take *these* classes, add *these* projects to your portfolio, and practice *these* algorithms. Such articles serve a useful purpose, but there are too many of them already. And that's part of the problem. There is too much information. If you're like me, the problem isn't that you haven't found that one sacred bit of information that you clearly have been lacking. Rather, the problem is that you're spinning your wheels because you're not committing to a strong filter for the information in your environment.

*Here is my philosophy on this topic:* 

You almost always need help building your filter. You need to discover two things: (1) what you'll actually be doing in a specific data science role, and (2) what you lack in order to excel in that role.

To get a better sense of what a data scientist is doing

If you have not built anything with a machine learning model, you need to jump in. Don't fret over the project. It doesn't need to be a research paper with a novel finding. At this point, you are just getting your feet wet and learning the ropes. In my opinion, the two greatest free resources for doing this are:

- (1)

The act of publishing something uncomfortable like this is exactly the type of thing that will change my course. Exposure. Vulnerability. Acting instead of merely being acted upon. And the act of putting something out there creates a sort of momentum. It is not an inevitable, unstoppable momentum. It is just a little nudge. But that little nudge makes the next nudge easier. And this is important for a field like data science, where things move quickly. Where speed is just as important as accuracy.

- Short-term Sal (impress employer and get a job as soon as possible)
- Long-term Lee (get deep understanding and get a job when ready)
- Most people expect Long-term Lee to surpass Short-term Sal eventually. But the biggest growth factor is full-time employment in DS, not deep preparation for that job. Short-term Sal always wins.
#### As soon as possible, you need your study/skill-building to be dictated by someone who is paying you


### What is the fastest way to become a data scientist?

Decide that you are one right now and start acting like it. 

Here's some actual advice. Become a freelance data scientist for one or two days. Seriously. Go to [upwork.com](http://upwork.com) and sign up. It will take only a few minutes. Now look at the type of jobs people are posting. How many can you confidently do right now? When I did this, my impostor syndrome flared up like a bonfire. But it gave me some important data that I haven't had up until now: **what kinds of tasks will I be asked to do as a professional data scientist?**

Find a successful freelancer (on upwork, etc) and reach out to them.
- you'll work for them for free for a certain amount of time/projects
- in return, you get to shadow them and see how they work
- you get valuable experience and exposure to proven techniques
- they get leverage to do more and increase their revenue

I actually think it will be helpful to try and do freelancing for more than just a few days. My most recent job was in consulting, so I'm pretty familiar with the lifestyle. How many contracts have I landed? Zero. I just started. But the act of actually sitting down and writing a pitch for one of these freelance contracts has made me realize that I've been approaching this in the wrong way. Instead of thinking in terms of "What do I know?", it became clear that I needed to start thinking in terms of "What can I do?" and "How can I do it quickly and in a way that will impress the client?"

Here are some mantras:

- **Stop passively consuming information.** Get into the habit of capturing that information, synthesizing it with what you already know, and doing something with it. This will slow down your consumption of information, and it will force you to be more selective about what you consume.
- **Learn the minimum necessary for each project.** Don't take MOOCs. Don't pay for degrees. In most cases, you'll never use what you learned before you forget it and have to go back and learn it again if and when it becomes relevant for your job. Instead, cherry-pick the minimum information that you need for each project. 
- Get feedback from target audience ASAP. 


### Funnels
- Information capture
- Information filter
- Information categorization and contextualization
- Information usage during creation/building

#### Need/skill framework
Most people have a poor sense of the need. So they focus on building a broad range of skills that they assume will be impressive or that they may need in the future. 
You need to focus on building your need rather than your skill.
How do you build your need? By getting error signals from the most valuable sources. Not all error signals are of equal value. Where are your error signals coming from?
