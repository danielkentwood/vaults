# The Ethics of Memory
parent:: [[the self]], [[∑ Tabernacles]]

About a year after Kristen and I were married, we were driving somewhere when she asked me, with a sly grin, "Guess what happens on February 18th?"

"Oh, no," I replied. "Sean's birthday!" A wave of panic swept over me as I realized that I had completely forgotten about my brother's birthday. Then a wave of absolute terror gripped me as I looked at the expression on Kristen's face.

"Is there anything else that is happening on that day?"

I frantically scanned my sparse inner calendar for a few moments, and then I remembered: "Our first anniversary?"

I have a less-than stellar relationship with my own brain. It consistently lets me down when my need is greatest. By now, my poor memory is somewhat legendary among my family and friends, a sort of running joke. My mom's favourite nick-name for me was "the absent-minded professor" long before I had any dreams of becoming a professor. So when I was asked to speak today on the topic of my personal journey of discipleship, I couldn't help but come back again and again to one of the things that has largely shaped my decisions along that journey: my memory.

More specifically, I want to talk about the ethics of memory. And to break it down just a bit further, I want to talk about two ethical duties that we have:

1. Sometimes we have a duty to remember.

2. Sometimes we have a duty to forget

But memory is a problematic thing for all of us, not just me.

First, most of our experiences with memory don't happen because we chose to remember something -- rather, we simply remember. We are reminded. On a similar note, memory doesn't always cooperate when we want it to. Having the name of an acquaintance or a song on the tip of your tongue for a few minutes can be frustrating, but it certainly illustrates the point that we are not always fully in control of our memory.

Second, if healthy memory is uncooperative, then unhealthy memory can be downright rebellious. There are so many fascinating and tragic things that can happen to our memory as a result of brain damage. Amnesia has many flavours and can come from a number of sources: trauma, dementia, epilepsy, drug use, psychiatric disorders, etc. What are the ethical and spiritual implications for people who physically cannot remember because of damage to their brain?

Third, and last: memory is not what most people think it is. Memory is not a faithful record of what occurred in the past, as if our brains were computers with a media library on a hard drive. The process of recalling a memory is more like reconstructing the scene anew each time rather than encountering the already fully intact, richly detailed scene somewhere in our brains. In other words, memory is a lot like imagination guided by a few basic suggestions about what happened. This makes our memories, even at the best of times, susceptible to bias, judgment, and manipulation.

Now, I hope I have shaken your confidence in your memory somewhat. Just one more reason to not rely upon the arm of the flesh, as Nephi puts it.

It is with this humility regarding our memory that we should approach our most frequent and fundamental covenant with the Lord: the covenant that we renew weekly during Sacrament. As part of this covenant, we promise that we will "always remember" Christ. Knowing what we know about how weak our memories are, it would be quite difficult to make this promise once and for all, and have any confidence that we could possibly hold up our end of the bargain. But then again, we are renewing this covenant each and every week, and perhaps the weakness of our memories is an insight into why such frequent renewal is necessary.

The word "remember" occurs 157 times in the Book of Mormon. Indeed, the Book of Mormon can be described as a record of a civilization as it continually struggles, and ultimately fails, to remember God. The scriptures tell us about our duty to remember with the literary equivalent of a smack in the face with a hammer. Nothing subtle about it. What about our duty to forget, though? This isn't as obvious, but the injunction is clearly there.

A number of passages speak about our duty to forget about the sins of a past that we have forsaken. One of my favourites comes from Isaiah:

[Isaiah 54:4](http://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/isa/54.4?lang=eng#3)

4 Fear not; for thou shalt not be ashamed: neither be thou confounded; for thou shalt not be put to shame: for thou shalt forget the shame of thy youth, and shalt not remember the reproach of thy widowhood any more.

The most compelling call for us to forget certain things, however, comes from the example of Christ himself. He said:

[Doctrine and Covenants 58:42](http://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/58.42?lang=eng#41)

42 Behold, he who has repented of his sins, the same is forgiven, and I, the Lord, remember them no more.

Now, isn't that amazing? Christ, the same person who said:

15 Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? yea, they may forget, yet will I not forget thee.

16 Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of *my* hands; thy walls *are* continually before me.

This same exalted person is saying, "I will remember (your sins) no more."

If God, who is our ultimate judge and who is aware of all things, feels compelled to forget certain things about his children, how much more should we, with our horrible memories and short-sighted judgment, feel compelled to forget those things about his children, our brothers and sisters?

**MEMORY AND LOVE**

The thread that connects our efforts to balance our remembering and forgetting is love. I want to focus the remainder of my remarks upon the connection between memory and love. And again, I want to reiterate that this is the theme that jumped out to me as I tried to encapsulate my personal journey of discipleship. Most of my lessons along the way, it seems, have been designed to teach me this.

Two days ago, my supervisor came in and told me that 20 children had been massacred by a gunman at a Connecticut elementary school. We both cried, and after he left, the only thing I could think about was getting home to be with my daughter. In situations like this, we have a moral obligation to do a good many things beyond going home and embracing our loved ones: to reach out, if possible, to those who have been affected; to push our politicians for change, or at least to more earnestly engage in the conversation about change; to think deeply about the cultural and institutional threads that support behaviours like this, etc. All of these are part of a larger duty that confronts us after such a tragedy: the duty to remember.

Why do we have a holiday called Remembrance Day? Or, if you're in the USA, Memorial Day? What exactly is the purpose of a moment of silence? What good does it do us to dwell upon the death of so many people?

Why is there an entire museum devoted to the Holocaust? The systematic extermination of a race of people in the most degrading and merciless fashion doesn't strike me as a pleasant topic. So why is that when we walk through the halls of a museum that is devoted to cataloguing and presenting this tragedy to us in all of its soul-numbing detail, we feel something warm stirring inside of us? The bitter sorrow is laced with something sweet, somehow. What is it? A solidification of resolve that this will not happen again? An admiration of the bravery of those who suffered and those who liberated the suffering? **Whatever else it is, I can't help but see that it is love.** Our natural response to such suffering is love and compassion, which, when taken to its extreme, is perhaps the most powerful catalyst for personal and collective change. So why does something like the Holocaust museum exist? Because in the act of remembering the tragedy, our hearts respond in loving ways that minimize the chances that such a tragedy will ever happen again. This is one very practical outcome of remembering tragedies.

Here's another: When we suffer, that suffering becomes part of our identity. This is true both as individuals and as groups of people. The suffering that the early Saints endured as they searched in vain for a welcoming home in the eastern states, and ultimately pushed across the plains to Utah -- this suffering is still part of our collective identity as a people. We sing songs of pioneers and their bravery. In Utah, Pioneer Day is one of the biggest celebrations of the year. This is all because we collectively, and to some degree individually, see ourselves as part of that same tradition: we are a tough people, able to overcome adversity through faith, able to consecrate our lives to the cause of preserving and perpetuating and sharing the joy that we have found in the Gospel of Christ -- we are modern pioneers, pushing through the moral wilderness and fighting against an invisible hunger and fatigue and chill. And this is how we want to be thought of, and remembered.

And, just to connect the LDS and Jewish ideas for moment: it is for this very reason that we have, as a Church, established the policy of not conducting vicarious temple work for those who were in any way victimized by the Holocaust. It is because we should know what it is like to remember and honour our ancestors who were persecuted and murdered specifically because of their beliefs. As much as we believe that we are loving and serving those Holocaust victims by opening the door to Gospel ordinances for them, we are at the same time treading upon the hallowed ground of the memories of their children and grandchildren, stripping them of the most basic aspects of their identity -- their Jewishness, for which they were murdered. And so, out of love and respect, we refrain from doing temple work for these people, and we let God work out the details. In the meantime, it is a **love-inspired** preservation of a particular memory that we are concerned with, and that we have a duty to carry out.

This is love from one group of people to another, through a sort of collective remembering. I want to focus on the personal duty to love and therefore selectively remember things about our neighbour.

Two great commandments. We have a duty to love - and I want to touch upon how this translates into a duty to remember and forget.

1 Peter 4:8 (NIV) Above all, love each other deeply, because love covers over a multitude of sins.

Proverbs 17:9 (NIV) He who covers over an offense promotes love, but whoever repeats the matter separates close friends.

So loving someone involves selectively remembering and forgetting things about them.

As Jacob 3 implies, there is certain kind of "firmness of mind" required for the experience of love. This is because love is a behaviour that reaches beyond knowledge and certainty; it is a commitment in the face of uncertainty, and it is antithetical to the type of flexible, noncommittal approach of one who is governed by the rule of good faith and certainty, rather than faith and commitment. This firmness of mind involves a willingness to close oneself off to certain type of evidence -- it is an unabashedly biased and unbalanced filtering of what one is prepared to believe about the beloved. And this way of thinking is incompatible with a behavioural code that would have all of our beliefs and actions based upon nothing but a balanced, unbiased survey of the evidence.

**Our duty to forget**

Forgiveness.

"Seeking occasion":

[Doctrine and Covenants 64:8](http://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/64.8?lang=eng#7)

8 My disciples, in days of old, sought occasion against one another and forgave not one another in their hearts; and for this evil they were afflicted and sorely chastened.

What does it mean to seek occasion?

Building a case against them.

Waiting for them to fail so we can be justifiably offended.

We seek occasion with each other far too often. Opposite is 13th article of faith, applied to people.

The irony of seeking occasion: it increases the chances that the person will do what we are about to blame them for doing.

The take-home message:

We love other people by selectively remembering and forgetting certain things about them.

**What to remember and forget**

What we (choose to) remember about others changes who they are.

If I consistently forget all of the instances where my co-worker has been snarky or rude, and only remember the instances where he has been kind, generous, and encouraging, then I will treat him as someone who is kind, generous, and encouraging. And I'll talk about him behind his back as someone who is kind, generous, and encouraging. And it will be absolutely genuine, because I will honestly not remember the times when he has been snarky or rude. And as he gains more evidence (from my behaviour and the behaviour of others who have come to see him similarly) that he is kind and generous, he will begin to act that way more frequently, and as I observe this, it will only strengthen my hypothesis that he is kind and generous. It is all a big circle, and we can make this circle a downward spiral or an upward spiral.

**The atonement and memory**

Reconstructing our stories and the stories of others. My personal experience with this.

NOTES

12 And it came to pass that he rent his coat; and he took a piece thereof, and wrote upon it—In memory of our God, our religion, and freedom, and our peace, our wives, and our children—and he fastened it upon the end of a pole.

[Alma 36:19](http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/36.19?lang=eng#18)

19 And now, behold, when I thought this, I could remember my pains no more; yea, I was harrowed up by the memory of my sins no more.
