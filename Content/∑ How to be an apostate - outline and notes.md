# Introduction

Apostasy is meant to be scary and difficult. I want to suggest some ways to make it less scary and less difficult.

There are unhealthy and healthy forms of apostasy. A healthy apostasy can be a model for a healthy exit from any type of group or relationship.

# 1. What are we leaving?

Summary: When we leave a social network, we perturb not only that network but also our selves (i.e., internal networks) in ways that will resist change. What is it about these external and internal networks that makes it so difficult to leave? How does knowing about these networks and how they work help us in our navigation of leaving? 

## 1.1 We are nodes in a graph
### 1.1.1
What are some of the forces that keep us in the network?
* Things that influence how others in the network perceive you
* Heritage (i.e., how old is your particular tree within the graph?)
* Network specific mechanisms. Examples from mormonism:
	* the sealing to your family
	*

#### NOTES for WHAT ARE WE LEAVING?

- when we leave, we are disrupting two things:
	1. external: a social network (even if that network consists of just two people, which it never does — e.g., the end of a marriage never affects just the two people in the marriage), and 
	2. internal: the network of models (of needs and their satisfaction) that constitute our self
- all networks seek equilibrium
	- Equilibrium is always reached when entropy (i.e., uncertainty, disorder, mixedupness) reaches a steady state for the system. 
	- In a closed system, the probability that entropy will decrease gets exponentially smaller over time. In other words, entropy tends to increase until it reaches its maximum. 
	- Wikipedia entry on [Entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy): "the entropy measures the degree to which the probability of the system is spread out over different possible [microstates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microstate_(statistical_mechanics) "Microstate (statistical mechanics)")"
	- In statistical mechanics, entropy is characterized as the number of ways the component parts of the full system can be arranged in such a way that they produce the distribution of observable macroscopic states of the system.
	- Entropy, and therefore equilibrium, can be defined differently for different systems. 
		- For example, a social network is at equilibrium when a particular shape or hierarchy in the graph is preserved. There is local and global equilibrium: a very large social network can be at equilibrium globally in spite of constant sub-graph changes that introduce local disequilibrium, as long as the entropy remains maximized. Some social networks are more robust to entropy (i.e., their equilibrium point is at a much higher state of entropy); these types of networks are harder to perturb from equilibrium. 
		- Conversely, a human is a system of networks that are at equilibrium when its needs are satisfied, and since humans differ in how their needs are satisfied, their definitions of equilibrium will differ.
	- the entropy of a social network is partly a function of the alignment between what constitutes equilibrium for the network, and what constitutes equilibrium for the individual humans within the network. The amount of entropy the humans introduce into the social network will determine the network's equilibrium.
	- Certain beliefs or commitments, if you can manage to authentically hold them, can act as entropy vacuums. Religion is an example. This is another reason that it is so difficult to give up religious commitments. Unless you have already done the difficult work of re-distributing the entropy that was being funneled into religion, dropping the religion may introduce a catastrophic amount of entropy into the rest of the network.

	- notion of graph entropy: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_entropy
		- from chatGPT: 
			- In graph theory, the concept of entropy can be used to measure the amount of disorder or uncertainty in a graph. It is based on the idea of Shannon entropy, which is a measure of the amount of information contained in a message or signal. In a graph, entropy can be used to measure the amount of uncertainty or randomness in the connections between the nodes. For example, a graph with high entropy would have a large number of nodes that are connected in a random or unpredictable way, while a graph with low entropy would have a small number of nodes that are connected in a more organized or predictable way.
			- the concept of centrality can be related to the concept of graph entropy. Centrality measures are used to identify the most important nodes in a graph based on the connections they have to other nodes. For example, a node with a high degree centrality (i.e., a node that is connected to many other nodes) would be considered more central or important in the graph. In contrast, a node with a low degree centrality (i.e., a node that is only connected to a few other nodes) would be considered less central or important in the graph. The degree centrality of a node is often used as a measure of its influence or importance within the graph. However, centrality measures can also be used to quantify the level of disorder or uncertainty in a graph. For example, a graph with a high level of degree centrality variation (i.e., where some nodes have a very high degree centrality and others have a very low degree centrality) could be considered more disordered or uncertain compared to a graph with a lower level of degree centrality variation. In this sense, centrality measures can be related to the concept of graph entropy.
			- the concept of entropy can be applied at different scales in a graph, including at the level of subgraphs, neighborhoods, and individual nodes. For example, you can measure the entropy of a subgraph by considering the connections between the nodes within the subgraph. A subgraph with high entropy would have a large number of nodes that are connected in a random or unpredictable way, while a subgraph with low entropy would have a small number of nodes that are connected in a more organized or predictable way. Similarly, you can measure the entropy of a neighborhood around a particular node by considering the connections between the nodes in the neighborhood. A neighborhood with high entropy would have a large number of nodes that are connected in a random or unpredictable way, while a neighborhood with low entropy would have a small number of nodes that are connected in a more organized or predictable way. You can also measure the entropy of an individual node by considering the connections between the node and its neighbors. A node with high entropy would be connected to a large number of other nodes in a random or unpredictable way, while a node with low entropy would be connected to a small number of other nodes in a more organized or predictable way. Overall, the concept of entropy can be used to measure the level of disorder or uncertainty in a graph or a subcomponent of a graph, such as a subgraph, neighborhood, or individual node.
			- In the context of graph entropy, the term "predictability" or "non-randomness" refers to the degree to which the connections between nodes follow a certain pattern or structure. For example, a graph with predictable or non-random connections would have nodes that are connected in a way that follows a certain rule or pattern, while a graph with unpredictable or random connections would have nodes that are connected in a more haphazard or unstructured way. Here are a few examples to illustrate this concept:
				- A graph with a "small-world" structure, where most nodes are connected to a relatively small number of neighbors, but there are also a few long-range connections between distant nodes, would have a low level of entropy. This is because the connections between the nodes follow a predictable pattern (i.e., most nodes are connected to a small number of neighbors, but there are also a few long-range connections).
				- A graph with a "scale-free" structure, where a small number of nodes have a very high degree (i.e., they are connected to many other nodes) and the majority of nodes have a much lower degree, would also have a low level of entropy. This is because the connections between the nodes follow a predictable pattern (i.e., a small number of nodes have a very high degree and the majority of nodes have a much lower degree).
				- A graph with a completely random structure, where each node is connected to other nodes with equal probability, would have a high level of entropy. This is because the connections between the nodes are completely random and do not follow any particular pattern.
			- Overall, the concept of entropy in a graph reflects the degree to which the connections between nodes follow a certain pattern or structure. A graph with low entropy would have connections that are more predictable or non-random, while a graph with high entropy would have connections that are more unpredictable or random.
			- From me: "With this formulation, entropy appears to be a structural property of a static graph. However, I am interested in quantifying the dynamic stability of subsets of a graph over time. For example, if I have a graph representing a social network, there may be subsets of that graph that are more susceptible to significant reorganization if a given number of connections are pruned. Critically, the reorganization is driven by an inherent property of the nodes. In this example, the nodes are people, and people are motivated to find connection in social groups. Given this motivation, if we prune enough connections between an individual and a specific social group, that individual may seek connections with a new group. Is entropy a helpful concept if I want to quantify this kind of dynamic stability? Or does it require a different conceptual framework?"
			- It is possible to use the concept of graph entropy to quantify the dynamic stability of subsets of a graph over time. Specifically, you can calculate the entropy of a subgraph or neighborhood at different points in time, and compare the entropy values to understand how the level of disorder or uncertainty in the subgraph or neighborhood changes over time. For example, in the case of a social network, you could calculate the entropy of a subgraph or neighborhood representing a particular social group at different points in time, and compare the entropy values to understand how the structure of the group changes over time. If the entropy of the group decreases over time, it could indicate that the group is becoming more organized or cohesive, while an increase in entropy could indicate that the group is becoming more disordered or uncertain. Overall, the concept of graph entropy can be a useful tool for quantifying the dynamic stability of subsets of a graph over time, as it allows you to measure the level of disorder or uncertainty in the connections between the nodes. However, it is important to note that entropy is just one measure of stability, and there may be other factors (such as the inherent properties of the nodes, as you mentioned) that could also influence the stability of a subgraph or neighborhood over time.
			- From me: "I want to develop a concept of stability that applies to the classification of a node as a member of a specific group of nodes within a graph. I want to incorporate edge weights into this concept. When the sum of the edge weights between a node and other nodes that belong to the group is positive, the node remains in the group. When the sum of edge weights is negative, the node exits the group. I want this concept to quantify the likelihood that the node will change its membership in the group."
			- It sounds like you are interested in developing a measure of stability that reflects the likelihood that a node will change its membership in a group based on the sum of the edge weights between the node and other nodes in the group. One way to approach this problem would be to use the concept of graph entropy to quantify the level of uncertainty or disorder in the connections between the node and the other nodes in the group. For example, you could calculate the entropy of the subgraph or neighborhood around the node, taking into account the edge weights between the node and the other nodes in the group. If the entropy of the subgraph or neighborhood is high, it could indicate that the connections between the node and the other nodes in the group are more random or uncertain, which could make it more likely that the node will change its membership in the group. In contrast, if the entropy of the subgraph or neighborhood is low, it could indicate that the connections between the node and the other nodes in the group are more predictable or structured, which could make it less likely that the node will change its membership in the group. Overall, the concept of graph entropy can be a useful tool for quantifying the stability of a node's membership in a group based on the connections between the node and the other nodes in the group, especially if you take into account the edge weights between the nodes. However, it is important to note that entropy is just one measure of stability, and there may be other factors (such as the inherent properties of the nodes) that could also influence the stability of a node's membership in a group.
- It is important to recognize individual differences in the tolerance for uncertainty/ambiguity. This can apply to a person's tolerance for uncertainty in relationships, beliefs, commitments, etc.
- There are multiple complex drives/needs that determine why someone leaves a community. It is a function of the core needs that direct the individual's identity. A person may have entirely negative relationships with people in a group, but may choose to continue identifying as a member of that group. Some examples:
	- Someone remains in an abusive family relationship. Why? 
		- Their template for family relationships involves abuse.
		- They feel external social pressure to remain in the family arrangement (e.g., they are catholic and divorce doesn't feel like an option without disrupting many other areas of life) 
	- Someone knows that their religion is toxic and they feel ostracized by members of the religion, but they remain. Why? 
		- They have a small number of close relationships (spouse, parent, etc) with members of the religion, and they don't want to disturb those relationships
		- Leaving the religion would require the reorganization of many beliefs, which is difficult and scary.

##### Graph-based notion of psychological/existential health
- I think there is an implicit normativity in the notion of graph stability that I'm exploring here. I'm trying to get at a universal notion of overall "health" of the graph. Trying to do that for all people might be difficult. Some people desire chaos and are not comfortable with stability. Is there a meta notion of stability for these people? In other words, when these people who seek chaos and change feel like they are thriving, _something_ is maximally stable? 



For the last twenty years, I have been fascinated (actually, *haunted* is probably a better description) by the philosophical problem of how the structure and function of the nervous system gives rise to meaningful experience. Lots of brain activity plays no direct role in our experience. Is there any theory out there that explains which features of neural activity determine the phenomenology that is available to an organism? 

No solution to this problem, so I think at best it is helpful to look for morphological symmetries between the neural and phenomenological levels of experience. There is no guarantee that these symmetries will tell us anything true about the true relationship. We are too good at finding patterns. 

But I am doing something here that does not require a “true” description of the link between the two. At the neural level, the graph is not just an analogy. It is a mathematical simplification of what is happening. It is a model. 

At the phenomenological level, it is also a model, although it is less clear that it is a good model. For example, I think Putnam’s “web of belief” captures some important features about how belief works, but I think “belief” as a phenomenon needs to be better understood before we can decide whether a model of it is good or not. 

I don’t need to explain how these are related (and I’m only feeling the pressure to do so because the graph seems like a good model for both of them). The graph approach to understanding them can yield good insights, and we can be careful to not assume that because the graph works a particular way in one domain, it must work in a similar way in the other domain.

So why do I need to talk about both here? Are both levels at play somehow when someone is leaving? 

Is a healthy apostasy facilitated by exposure to the idea that the following are embedded in a network?

- network of beliefs? Yes, helpful.
- network of needs and skills for satisfying them? Yes, helpful.
- network of neurons? Not clear that this is helpful, unless we want to make the claim that equilibrium at the phenomenological level is co-extensive with equilibrium at the neural level. I mean, this is going to be true in some trivial sense; everything we experience is an emergent property of neural activity. But is it the case that the type of disequilibrium introduced by apostasy (e.g., stress and anxiety because we have lost our place in a social group) can be mapped onto a single neural phenomenon that achieves equilibrium only when our need for social belonging has been satisfied? Are needs and their satisfaction the bridge between phenomenology and neural levels of description? Not directly. We only experience a need as a determinate need after we have figured out how to satisfy it. Prior to that, it is an ambiguous experience that we must clarify through exploration. Many needs never get determined; they are silenced by the satisfaction of other needs.
- From a graph perspective, what is a need? There is a causal element here, in the sense that the need drives our behavior. But it is important to remember that it drives behavior often in ways that we don’t understand, so we build models of our needs. The models of our needs are, in fact, the skills for satisfying those needs. The graph-level definition of our need will point to a model of the need, not the need itself. Thus, the model of our need may try to capture the causal nature of the need, but it is not itself driving behavior in the same way that the need is driving behavior. It may be involved in driving different kinds of behaviors (e.g., trying to anticipate our needs, like going to sleep before we are tired), but that would be an entirely different causal pathway.
- What is it about the need are we modeling? Consider Marr’s three levels of analysis:
    - **Computation:** What is the logic behind the need? What is it ultimately trying to accomplish?
    - **Algorithm:** What is the pseudo-code for implementing the logic of the need? What are the algorithmic steps that describe the need?
    - **Implementation:** How is the need implemented biologically?
    
    And I would add one more:
    
    - **Phenomenology**: What role, if any, does the need play in our experience?  What motivational states accompany the need? What actions does it influence? How does it condition perception and cognition?
    
    - There is the need (e.g., oxygenation of our blood; introducing sugar and proteins and water into our blood; spending sufficient time in sleep states) and then there is the motivational state that we experience as the correlate of that need. We feel out of breath. We feel hungry and thirsty. We feel tired.
    - When we attempt to give a definition of a need, we are pressured to appeal to evolution. Especially when we are talking about a physiological need without which we would not survive. If our survival is dependent on satisfying a particular need, some random genetic selection pressure is responsible for giving us to the tool(s) to satisfy it.
    - Characterized one way, the need is the function that the model is trying to optimize (e.g., maximize reward, minimize error). The skill is the matrix of weights that result in an output that satisfies the need. Phenomenologically, we experience (1) somatic correlates of the need, like motivational states, (2) the behavioral output of the model, and (3) somatic correlates of satisfaction of the need, like reward, satiety, etc.
    - Characterizing the need as the objective function is a way of describing the fact that the need exists. If we want to talk about the state of needing, we need to have a concept of baseline and the ability to detect when the system is not close to baseline. Take the example of sleep. The human body has a need for sleep because there are certain regulatory processes (e.g., metabolic, memory consolidation, etc) that only come online during sleep; the objective function is something like the minimization of disequilibrium activity in a neural assembly that is responsible for detecting time spent in a dysregulated state. So there needs to be a way for the body to detect (or anticipate) when it is in a dysregulated state; this will trigger modulatory inputs that result in a motivational state that we experience as sleepiness.
    - The need has an indeterminate relationship with motivational states.

Anxiety is an adaptive response to a lack of skills for meeting critical needs. It increases the urgency of that need, creating an extreme motivational state. There is a looping relationship between the need, its ambiguity, and the skills for properly satisfying the need. The more ambiguous the need, the less likely it is that we’ll find a way to satisfy it. But it is also the case that the need is ambiguous because we have failed to find a way to satisfy it. The more ambiguous the need, the higher our anxiety. 

Our needs exist on a spectrum of complexity. The least complex needs are physiological needs that determine our immediate survival. Our evolutionary history has selected for traits that allow us to rapidly develop skills for meeting such needs. Maslow’s level of “safety needs”, the level just below immediate physiological needs, are essentially those that deal with assuring ourselves that our physiological needs will be met in the future. As we mature, the burden of satisfying these needs shifts from the parent to the child, and the cognitive skillset for satisfying these needs can be quite complex in an urbanized, technological environment. A massive amount of anxiety springs from the ambiguity of this need, which, again, is just another way of saying that the skills to satisfy the need properly haven’t been developed yet.

So we tend to simply find ways of quieting the need. 

What is that need? To have access to a coherent, convincing narrative about oneself as an answer to the question, why did you do that?

Distraction quiets down most sources of stress and need, not just unmet needs related to the self. If we feel overworked and underslept, we may find ourselves browsing, watching tv, drinking, etc. Technology is finding more effective ways of perpetually quieting fundamental needs without actually satisfying them (cf. Infinite Jest). Good technology facilitates and encourages the true satisfaction of our needs. Bad technology facilitates and encourages the denial of our needs via perpetual distraction, i.e., perpetual temporary global satisfaction.



# 2. Why do we leave?

Main point:

### 2.1 Management of the self

### 2.2 Attachment and detachment

### 2.3 Pushing and pulling

The push and pull forces can be roughly mapped onto counter-will and will. The counter-will is a native, non-conscious drive to individuate. It arises when the autonomy of the self feels threatened. 

### 2.4 Faith and good faith

### 2.5 Models of apostasy

# 3. What comes after leaving?

- Main point: leaving disrupts equilibrium, and the process of finding equilibrium again can be difficult. Here are some things that might help.
- You can’t just decide to arbitrarily change your beliefs by force of will. Belief










# NOTES
- Ultimately, the answer to the question “Why do we leave?” is best fleshed out in the graph metaphor. We leave because of the pressures (pushing and pulling) that exist within our internal models (that can helpfully be characterized as hierarchical graphs). If the act of leaving is represented by formally/functionally renouncing a prior alignment (i.e., you take the socially/legally required steps to leave the religion, the marriage, the job, the team, etc.), then we can conceptualize this as the pruning of a node (i.e., oneself) in an external graph. We are a node in a social graph, and the difficulty of removing ourselves from that node will be a function of several things. One of the biggest factors is the degree to which we ourselves are affected by how others in the network respond to our removal.
- We are in a loop with the external social network. We anticipate what will happen when we act (e.g., leave), we act, and we evaluate what happens.
- Why would we want to consider leaving in the first place? Something has changed in a different network upstream, and this change has ultimately put tension on the part of our “self” that aligns with the group we are leaving. It suddenly costs more to stay than to leave because of this change.
- So what are some examples of upstream changes that would drive someone to leave a religion? There has been a change in belief, and it is not congruent with the tenets of the religion. There has been a change in instinct (e.g., deference to authority feels uncomfortable rather than comfortable). Whatever it is, the change is ultimately providing evidence that we no longer belong to this group. We act differently. We think differently. The other members of the group think we act/think differently. All of this evidence interacts with different needs that we have. It results in less satisfaction of some needs (which may pressure us to try and revert the changes that just happened, increasing the odds that we stay instead of leave) and/or more satisfaction of some needs (which reinforces the changes that just happened, increasing the odds that we leave).

### Sensorimotor loop

1. **Model**: our model of our world is constantly seeking equilibrium. If there is sufficient tension, it creates a need to act, to change something. Luckily, our model of the world allows us to “simulate” actions and predict their outcome before we commit to the action. 
2. **Prediction**: The decision process always involves a competition between predicted outcomes. In the case of an apostate, we may use our model to simulate leaving (perhaps several versions of leaving along with in order to predict how it might resolve the tension. We predict how much tension the act of leaving will create (i.e., we are predicting how the world will respond to our attempt to leave) and how much tension the act of leaving will resolve. This will determine whether we try it in the first place. 
3. **Action**: we implement our decision, whether to stay or leave.
4. **Feedback**: the world will respond, and we will filter that response through our expectations (i.e., the response we predicted). We will, in a biased way, look for evidence that our prediction was correct. Did it resolve more tension than it created? The answer to this last question is so complicated because we are capable of some pretty heavy biases that can dominate the equation. For example, if I have already told a lot of people that I am going to leave the church, I have in a very important way staked my reliability and predictability (at least in my relationships with those people) upon following through. If it turns out that leaving is not what I expected and it is going to create a large rift in my family, it may be difficult to incorporate that new information into my model in an unbiased way because it endangers a core belief about myself — that I follow through when I say I’m going to do something.
5. **Model (continuation of the loop)**: If there is a large enough mismatch between our expectations and what really happens, we will update our model of the world, and it may change our prediction of how our intervention will affect the tensions in the model. This may or may not result in a change in our decision to leave. 

** There isn’t a single persistent model that we use to predict our own behavior, and that is because there are several motivations for predicting our own behavior. This is true when we are predicting our behavior for our own purposes (e.g., introspection, etc) or explicitly in a social context. Anytime we point to past behavior, we do it to say something about the present or future behavior of the individual (we often point to past behavior in order to reveal something about the “self”, which persists in its special way as a thing that we use to explain and predict behavior over time). But notice that our goals and motivations fundamentally change the model that we are using to predict our behavior. It is not quite accurate to say that it is the same model (e.g., re-weighted). Rather, we are sampling completely different subgraphs (in other words, different models) in order to answer the same question. 

### 2.1 We are Nodes: Social networks

Why is it hard to leave a religion? Because it is responsible for deep connections in many different graphs. The difficulty of changing a node in the graph depends on the number and strength of connections to other nodes. 

- Family tree gets interpreted in the context of the religion. It is hard to reinterpret the meaning of your place in the family.
- Social networks are forged via membership in the religion. It is difficult to maintain relationships that depended on membership in the religion.

### 2.2 We are Graphs: The web of belief

- Beliefs are influenced by the religion. It is difficult to restructure beliefs.
- Belief without the “God” node

## NOTES

This is evolving into another piece about the self. Everything has to point to the goddamn self. This piece is all about the boundaries of the self. Here are some of the themes that are crowding into this piece. You need to whittle this down to the most essential parts of what you want to say.

- If you are leaving a religion, you have probably spent several years building up a sense of what you don’t believe. What is not good. Who you don’t want to be. You know exactly what is pushing you. You need to find something to pull you. Why it is better to be pulled out of the church rather than simply pushed? Because identifying what pushes you is the process of identifying what you are not. Identifying what pulls you is the process of identifying who you are.
- Why is it better to make your own map than copy other people’s maps? Why is it better to make your own map rather than just burn all the maps? Because you are the map.
- Finding the balance between commitment and impartiality, when it comes to certain types of commitments at least, is the same process as deciding on your boundaries. In either case, you are taking a stand. If you decide a particular statement requires more evidence in order to be believed, you are setting a boundary. If you decide that you will commit before you have all the evidence, you are setting a boundary. Without these boundaries, you are less of a self. You give people less to react to. You give yourself less data to work with. There is less intervention into the world because the world is primarily acting on you.
- **What is the problem?** Why is it particularly important for apostates to set these boundaries and draw these maps? Because many religions (especially those classified as “high-demand religions” like the LDS religion) really fuck with your boundaries. If you set boundaries that conflict with the doctrines or norms of the church, those boundaries must remain hidden to a degree. This is not healthy, and it forces you into situations where you have to be very ambiguous about who you are in order to be honest. It trains you to be cynical about many of your most important beliefs and commitments. This blurs your boundaries.
- **What is the problem?** Related to religion’s tendency to inhibit the member’s setting of personal boundaries: most religions push their members toward a view that humans have access to objective truth and that there is a prescribed method for accessing that truth. Ultimately, god is the arbiter of truth, and there is, in most cases, nothing stopping god from creating arbitrary systems of truth that humans have no access to unless it is through him. As science provides more explanations of phenomena, God becomes less of a causal/functional explanation, and more of a teleological explanation on the other side of the scientific explanation. And since science is still pretty ambiguous on the topic of selfhood, consciousness, ethics, emotions, values, etc., these are the areas where religion pushes hardest and asserts that god is the only source of truth. And since most people have a difficult time getting unambiguous answers from god about these things, religions appeal to human authority (scripture and prophets) and set varying levels of expectation to adhere to the boundaries set by the authority.
- **Models of apostasy.** The deficiency vs abundance models of apostasy can be fleshed out in terms of the self. The reason why so many members of the LDS church are incapable of seeing apostasy as anything other than a deficiency is that they are corralled into a conception of the self that is intertwined with the church; the boundaries of the church have become, in some of the most important respects, the boundaries of their self. An overabundance of belief and a setting of boundaries outside of the church’s boundaries looks to most LDS members like a deficient, impoverished self. Take a stand against what is wrong. Take a stand about what you believe is right. Stand.
- **Models of apostasy.** Encourage members who want to remain in the church to be apostates and to reclaim the word “apostasy”. To the extent that they feel they are able, they should try their best to develop their selves by taking a stand.
- **Articles of faith.** Writing down your “articles of faith” is an exercise that can help you identify where you haven’t yet taken a stand. It can (and should) be infinitely revisable, but that shouldn’t stop us from taking a stand. We don’t have to stand in the same place, as long as we are standing.
- **Web of belief.** The web of belief and its role in determining certainty. Each node in the web has a certain amount of energy assigned to it as soon as there is a possibility that it could change in some specific way. This is the amount of energy that it would require for an individual to restructure their web (and their life) if that node were to change or be removed in that specific way. The energy value is gathered from the node’s connections and their respective energy values (which recursively will be decided by the energy states assigned to the changes of their connections). **Maybe write a separate piece on this that meshes Quine’s web of beliefs (and its philosophical descendants) with graph theory and neuroscience. Some version of this energy story is probably true at the neural level as well.** Some parts of the web are so interconnected that altering/removing them would require too much energy to restructure the web. The certainty that we experience about propositions is roughly equal to the energy that would be required for us negate or modify their node in our web. When we conceptualize belief and certainty in this way, it has implications for how we strike our balance between commitment and partiality. Specifically, it implies that finding that balance requires both creativity and discovery. In other words, the web of belief is the sum of all of our models of the world and the self.
- **Web of belief.** How can we engage creatively with the web of belief? Well, it is absolutely revisable at the conscious level. Your conscious experience of deciding whether you are capable of adding a new node or modifying/deleting a new one is precisely a function of the connections in your web. So the web is there whether we interact with it or not. But you can learn about it by probing it. By trying to change it and add to it. You’ll learn what you’re capable of changing and what you aren’t.
- **Web of belief.** Just like any other network, there can be redundancy. You might be undecided about something, so there are competing nodes. The more competition, the less catastrophic when one of the competing nodes drops out. This means that we can afford to demand more evidence before we achieve certainty. When there is only one possible node pointing to a certain type of proposition, and when that node is highly connected, it must be protected at all costs, and this is when commitment outstrips evidence. This explains love and religion. The moment we entertain the possibility of competing nodes, evidence starts to matter more. So how do we bootstrap commitment? Simple. We eliminate competitors. Simple in theory at least. When a competitor is lodged firmly into its own rich network and if it is effective at satisfying an important need, pruning that competitor will require some consistent and thoughtful work over an extended period. Ask yourself what the major connections to that node are, and figure out how you can replace the function that the to-be-pruned node is performing for them.
- **Web of beliefs.** This creates an ontology that is rooted by primitives. Some of these primitives are bodily needs and skills that we creatively discover. Some of them are fundamental cultural systems like linguistics, reason, logic, sensory/perceptual/motor primitives, etc. These are the anchors in our web. We can refine these primitives through exploration. But we cannot arbitrarily change them because they are ultimately rooted in the structure of our body, the structure of the world, or the interaction between them.
- **Web of belief.** There is an important distinction between propositions that I would agree with (or, at least, propositions that I wouldn’t want to deny), and propositions that I believe and that merit a node in the web. If someone were to ask me if I am certain that all french people are not, in fact, only pretending to speak french all of the time because their true language (which they never speak to anyone including each other) is too embarrassing, I would respond that I am indeed certain. But this certainty rests entirely upon my reluctance to engage in the metaphysical restructuring that would be required in order to believe something like that. There is no sense in which I actually hold the belief that french people are not hiding their true language. Just because you’re certain of something, it doesn’t mean you hold a belief about it. Otherwise, we’d be forced to say that, without knowing it, we have an infinite set of beliefs about the things that are not the case.
- **Graphs.** The graph needs to be a dominant metaphor for this article. Leaving the church is so difficult because you are a node in a graph. The more connected you are, the more your social world is perturbed when you leave. The number of connections and the strength of those connections matter. And the nature of the connections. I have a very strong connection with my father. To the extent that my connection with him depends on me being a Mormon, that connection will be weakened to the same degree if I stop being a Mormon.
- **Graphs.** Think about different kinds of graphs and how different social groups and subgroups instantiate those different kinds of graphs. Some have more hierarchy than others.
- **Graphs.** We are all nodes in a graph. We are all members of different subgraphs. Those subgraphs essentially imbue the connection (‘edge’) between our node and the nodes were are connected to with different weights. The LDS weight in the edge between myself and an acquaintance at church probably constitutes most, if not all, of the weight in that edge. The LDS weight in the edge between me and my father was large, but definitely not the majority of the weight.
- **Graphs (causal subgraphs).** Essentially, we need to ask, in every case, “Why are these two nodes connected?” or “What are all of the causes for a connection between these two nodes?” This type of question is essentially asking, what are the causal subgraphs that this node is part of. These causal subgraphs are DAGs, but as they layer on top of each other and you collapse the sub-edges between nodes into single nodes, you can get cyclic graphs.
- **Graphs.** Getting pushed means simply pruning connections. Any new connections made after the pruning are essentially random or dictated by old habits and instincts, which are probably not what you want dictating your new connections if your goal is to change something about your life. Being pulled means that you’ve got new connections already forming with new subgraphs. This participation in a new subgraph does a few good things. It essentially provides competition for satisfying the same needs as older subgraphs. This makes it safer to prune connections to older subgraphs that have become dysfunctional/degradated. It’s totally possible to prune the connection to the bad subgraph just because it is bad, but that bad subgraph likely was satisfying some need. The need will find a way to be satisfied, and if we don’t get pulled into a healthy subgraph that satisfies the need, we run the risk of satisfying our needs in unhealthy ways.
- **Graphs (nested graphs versus subgraphs).** There are graphs within graphs: these are called subgraphs. We can conceive of ourselves as a node in an arbitrary number of subgraphs. For example, think of the graph of all humans. There are biological connections that form a causal DAG, and every human participates in this DAG. But there are other types of connections that flesh out friendship, group membership, and the infinite other ways that use other people to define who we are.
- **Graphs.** The nature of the web (graph) of beliefs. Ultimately, this web of beliefs is our attempt to create a cognitive model of internal models that mostly operate below the level of awareness. Think of the distinction between body image and body schema.
- **Graphs.** When it comes to our relationships between people, we **c**an think of ourselves as a node in either:
    - multi-layer graph where the layers are different reasons for having a relationship with someone. E.g., one layer has me connected to Ammon as someone who was raised LDS, another layer has me connected to him as someone interested in philosophy, etc.
    - multi-graph where there can be multiple edge-types between nodes.
   

Humans have two modes: The first, where we spend the most of our lives, is an automatic, absorbed state of being where we don’t experience the self in any thematic way. The second is a state of scrutiny within which the self appears as something that is always there. The state arises precisely because of the need to justify and tie together our actions in a cohesive narrative.

## ON MODELS AND THE SELF

1. Humans have evolved to depend heavily on their ability to predict. 
2. The ability to predict is facilitated by internal models. 
3. There are different kinds of models. 
    1. There are models for motor control, for example. 
        1. forward models (i.e., predict the output based on an input)
        2. inverse models (i.e., predict which input will result in a desired output)
    2. There are models of the external world. See this [wikipedia article on predictive coding.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_coding)
4. In every type of model, the goal of a model is to map inputs and outputs in a generalizable way. The generalizability constraint means that the model can’t pay too much attention to random fluctuations in the relationship between input and output; the model must have a way of regularizing (i.e., simplifying the model), or it will overfit to noise. 
5. When it comes to predicting what will come next in the external world (i.e., independent of our own bodies), we encounter varying levels of complexity. Babies are able to rapidly model the sensory statistics that are driven by the laws of physics (e.g., when something has nothing else under it, it moves toward the ground until it does have something under it). Some animals are not very complex, so their behavior is easy to predict. Other animals are more complex; as a result, they are harder to model, which is another way of saying that they are less predictable. 
    1. The predictability of an animal’s behavior is a function of:
        1. the correlation between the animal’s behavior and the shared sensory information in the environment. 
        2. the historical correlation between the animal’s observable behavior at time *t* and its observable behavior at time *t+1*.
6. With animals, we tend to build models that help us predict the behavior of groups (e.g., classes, species, breeds, etc.). Only very rarely do we see enough variance in the behavior between members of a species to warrant building a model of an individual member of the species. Some pets (e.g., dogs) and other animals (e.g., many other primates) rise to this level of complexity. 
7. Humans exhibit the most complex behavior of any organism, and are therefore the most difficult to model. This is true at the population and the individual level. Like we do with every other organism, we build models to predict the behavior of groups of people. But out of necessity, we also build models of humans at the individual level. 
8. The model that we build of the individual constitutes a self. We are essentially trying to understand the idiosyncratic drivers of their behavior. And since any human’s behavior is (relatively speaking) so poorly correlated with both the shared sensory environment and that human’s recent behavior, we are surprised by their behavior more than we are with any other organism. And since we lack insight into the true mechanics (due to their complexity), our model includes a black-box “free will” that ends up introducing noise into the statistics of an individual’s behavior.  
9. Since we generally suck at predicting and understanding our own behavior, we leverage the same type of model in order to understand and predict our behavior. 
10. Humans have a fundamental need to project a stable self that acts in ways that are predictable and sensible, both to ourselves and to others. The depth of this need can be measured by the multifaceted social consequences of landing somewhere outside of the normative bounds of sanity. 
11. In order to appear as a stable, sensible agent (both to others and ourselves), we construct narratives that explain and make sense of our actions.
12. Our narrative choices are constrained by the immediate evidence of our observations about our actions, the motivations we experience, and prior investments into a particular narrative. We regularly confabulate our motivations because we don’t have access to them.
13. The true causes and motivations for our actions are only loosely correlated with the narratives we construct in order to satisfy our need to appear as a stable, sensible agent.
14. I believe religion owes its existence to a fundamental human need to harmonize the dissonance that accompanies the cultivation of a self, and I believe contemporary religion often unintentionally magnifies that dissonance.

Let's start with an obvious answer: heritage. Mormonism is a fascinating case study on this topic; the LDS church is still young enough that it only takes a handful of generations to get back to the source: Joseph Smith. I grew up listening to stories about ancestors who interacted with Joseph Smith and the other early founders of the church. These stories have an almost mythological flavor. They are woven into the fabric of our family identity. I grew up with a heavy sense of momentum behind me, generated by the weight of generations of faithfulness. But even for first-generation converts to the LDS church, there is a mechanism that plugs them into a spiritual heritage. In a very real sense, a recent convert can immediately feel the considerable weight of their ancestors' hopes 
The LDS church bases its claims to divine authority on a lineage of physical transfer. Every priesthood holder can trace that lineage back to Joseph Smith, who claimed to have physically received the priesthood from resurrected biblical figures, whose own lineages can be traced back to Jesus or Adam. This creates a chain linking every priesthood holder to God. When a couple is married in the temple, that same priesthood lineage locks the entire family into a covenant-based chain with God. The goal is to save as many people as possible by linking them in this chain. This is why Mormons are so good at genealogy: they are trying to map all of humanity as a massive genealogical tree so that they can ensure that everyone, whether living or dead, has the option to accept the covenants that will forge their place in that divine chain.

I think the process of “finding your pull” can be broken down into two ideas:

1. **Seek balance between commitment and impartiality**
2. **Take responsibility for what your beliefs are**

I’ll flesh out these two ideas below. But first, I want to give a bit of context about my own journey and how I found my own pull.

### The Open Seas

I’m always hesitant to claim that I understand all the reasons for my own apostasy from the LDS church, but one thing stands out to me: a college course I took at BYU, of all places, on the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche. I know. *I know*. Can there be a more reliable cliché than the kid who was raised Christian and leaves the church after dabbling in undergrad philosophy? But reading Nietzsche didn’t convince me that God is dead, or that there were irreparable faults in Christianity. Rather, it convinced me that if I was going to leave the church, it would be because my instincts had changed. That is, I might spontaneously start to make sense of things in ways that depended on secular ideals and motivations that are incompatible with religious instincts. When I encountered this idea for the first time, I felt I had caught a glimpse of my future. I knew that my instincts were already changing. More changes seemed inevitable, and I remember fearing that it was only a matter of time before I was completely out of place at church.

I spent the first 37 years of my life as an active Mormon. The final decade of those years was spent as a closet agnostic. I told only a few close friends and family members. I wanted it to be a phase. I did everything I could to facilitate a return to the vibrant faith of my youth. I didn’t want to be the weak link in the chain. I didn’t want to deviate from the rich Mormon heritage that I was given, and I didn’t want to disappoint my parents. So I obeyed God’s laws, and when I stumbled, I repented immediately. I prayed, I fasted, I studied the scriptures, I worshipped in the temple, and I gave my time to some pretty demanding leadership positions. I desperately reached out for a divine hand. I spoke and I acted like a believer. But the whole project started to fall apart in 2016, and I tapped out in 2017.

As someone who is walking the path of an apostate, I can clearly see that it is not straight and narrow; there is no single right way to be an apostate. However, I believe that the dizziness and loneliness that apostates feel as they walk their path presents unique opportunities for growth, and I think it is easy to miss these opportunities if we’re not aware of them. As I’ve walked my own path, an image keeps coming back to me, helping me make sense of what I am experiencing: I feel like a ship that has spent its life in a beautiful, peaceful harbor, tethered down with not just one anchor, but many. And not only anchored to the ocean floor, but to other boats. Over time, whether by erosion or by my own hand, the anchors came out. After pulling up the final anchors, I found myself in the open sea — alone under dark skies, disoriented with no land on the horizon, battered by waves and storms. All of this, yes, but also: moving and changing and growing, feeling embarrassingly free, recapturing a sense of adventure, and, most importantly, finally honoring the fact that my compass had been pointing out toward the open sea for most of my adult life. There have been painful social reverberations of my choice. Going back to visit the harbor can sometimes be awkward, but I can’t remember having a stronger sense of who I am and what I need to do.

Floating aimlessly on the open seas is dangerous. Just like everyone else, I’ve  accumulated a lot of maps over the years, and I can always fall back on these in a pinch. But these maps often disagree with each other, they’re usually pretty outdated, and they were written by other people who had different worlds and different motivations than I do. I want to write my own map. It might end up looking a lot like other maps I’ve seen. But I will have explored the terrain myself, and this gives me power to decide which landmarks are worth including on my map. How do I make this decision?

### Articles of Faith

In the early days of Mormonism, Joseph Smith wrote a letter to John Wentworth, editor of the *Chicago Democrat*. This famous “Wentworth Letter” contained a short list of the most fundamental doctrines, practices, and creeds of Mormonism. The list has considerable overlap with [another list](https://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/digital/collection/NCMP1820-1846/id/7002/rec/1) of Mormon beliefs, written 8 years earlier by prominent church leader Oliver Cowdery. Cowdery’s list faded into obscurity. Joseph’s list became known as the [Articles of Faith](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/a-of-f/1?lang=eng), and is now accepted as scripture within the LDS Church.

The thirteenth and final Article of Faith states: “We believe all things, we hope all things […] If there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy, we seek after these things.” This rings similar to the final item in Cowdery’s list: “We believe in embracing good wherever it may be found; of proving all things, and holding fast that which is righteous.” Both of these find their genesis in Paul’s epistles:

> “Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.” (Philippians 4:8)
> 

> “Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.”  ([1 Thessalonians 5:21](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Thessalonians+5%3A21-23&version=KJV))


**Getting truth from everywhere**

Joseph Smith

“If I esteem mankind to be in error, shall I bear them down? No. I will lift them up, and in his own way if I cannot persuade him my way is better; and I will ask no man to believe as I do.”
(https://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/treasuring-all-truth#_ftn4)

And it was Joseph Smith who encouraged his followers to “get all the good in the world”(https://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/treasuring-all-truth#_ftn6) and to “receive truth, let it come from whence it may.”(https://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/treasuring-all-truth#_ftn7)

Scriptures

Mormons believe in learning “out of the best books”(https://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/treasuring-all-truth#_ftn13) of things that “have been, things which are, things which must shortly come to pass; things which are at home, things which are abroad; the wars and perplexities of the nations, … and a knowledge also of countries and of kingdoms.” (https://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/treasuring-all-truth#_ftn14)

I absolutely love this idea. *Find truth and goodness everywhere, not just in the church.* But I’ve often wondered if the expansiveness of this idea can fit within the epistemological hierarchy erected by the modern LDS Church. In Mormonism, God reveals personal truths directly to individuals, but he also reveals truths to you through ecclesiastical authorities who hold specific priesthood “keys” (i.e., permission to use the priesthood to receive revelation for other people). Critically, revelation from a leader trumps the individual search for truth. More accurately, revelation from priesthood leaders circumscribes the boundaries of truth within which an individual can “embrace good wherever it may be found.” The process of “finding out for yourself” consists of priesthood leaders pointing to a truth and asking, “Can you see this?” The acceptable answers to this question are “yes” and “not yet”; a negative answer means you haven’t understood the rules of the game. This constrains both the search for truth, making it hard to “prove all things”, as well as the acceptable range of what is good, making it hard to “hold fast that which is good” if the church leader disagrees with your sense of what is good.

I don’t see anything wrong with a religious community maintaining a clear set of moral beliefs as prerequisites for membership. If I want to be part of that community, I have to give up some autonomy in my search for truth and goodness. Conversely, however, such a community relinquishes the right to tell its members that they should search for truth and goodness everywhere. The LDS Church tries to do both, emphasizing both deference to authority and personal responsibility in the search for truth.

I’ve tried to explicitly confront and flesh out the agnosticism and secular instincts that characterized my private thoughts over the past decade. It has been an exhilarating experience to realize that I can believe *whatever I want;* I can rely more fully on my own sense of right and wrong rather than forcing myself to align with an external authority. I don’t have to worry about the way in which my exuberance about the theory of evolution runs up against a literal reading of the Adam and Eve account, for example. I don’t have to apologize for not believing that God exists, that there is a spiritual realm in the metaphysical sense, or that Mormonism is the only true church on the face of the earth. I can believe anything I want, and there are so many things out there that want to be believed.

The experience of wandering through this epistemological buffet has been intoxicating, especially after having built up such a hunger for new beliefs. But like many forms of intoxication, the pleasure and the release from inhibition are accompanied by a sort of dizziness. It is an unsettling feeling to willingly float out into the wide expanse of the ocean, losing sight of the land, after having been anchored in roughly the same spot in the harbor for your entire life.

Give examples of how people have tried to make sense of losing God, and what it does to your ability to find meaning.

The dilemma has nearly always been: keep God and have meaning, or choose your own beliefs at random, with no external validation, and despair at the fact that you are choosing your own meaning. But there seems to be a third alternative. While it is true that choosing your own beliefs and meanings is necessary after giving up on an external source of meaning (like God), it isn’t the case that these choices need to be arbitrary, or simply based on passing appetites, pressures, and drives; I believe there is a moral shape to a self at any given time, and if we learn how to be receptive and how to observe and describe, we can see enough of that moral self to feel a sense of compulsion in our explicit moral beliefs. We are still indexing our moral belief to something solid, but in this case it is something solid that might change tomorrow (because our selves are in constant flux). What we yearn for is a sense of discovery; we don’t want to be randomly fabricating meaning — this cheapens the meaning. We can achieve that sense of discovery by discovering a law within ourselves.

(I remember hearing sermons on the evils of subjectivism. The danger, as the story goes, is that if we are our own measures of truth, what is to stop us from simply deciding that whatever we do is good. We can justify anything, from dishonesty to murder (note that the first book of the book of the mormon has explicit examples of the author justifying dishonesty and murder because god told him to do it). There is a deep-rooted conviction that subjectivism leads directly to anarchy/chaos/etc. I couldn’t see it at the time, but what I see now is a profound lack of trust in the goodness of humans. Yes, it is true that if we are the foundation of our own beliefs about the world, we may see those beliefs change. This is only a problem if we think that humans are incapable of choosing good. What if it is the case that most humans are interested in doing good, in being socially beneficial, in helping each other, etc.? The fluctuations in their beliefs become much less scary. It is also worth pointing out that, despite the declarations that an external reference for beliefs — an objective approach to truth — results in fixed, unchanging beliefs, it simply isn’t true. The LDS church has evolved considerably, and will continue to do so. What exactly is the difference between the “objective” and “subjective” approach? Simply that the objective approach is naive, and it relegates the responsibility for owning one’s beliefs to that external reference.)

(As you start to commit to beliefs outside of the religious framework, you might find yourself struggling to locate a foundation for those beliefs. That search for an external foundation, for an assurance, for certainty — it is an instinct that has a formidable history of reinforcement from a religious system that trained you to feel uncomfortable with)

If you ask God to validate a revelation that someone else received on your behalf, what happens if God is silent? What if God tells you something that contradicts the revelation? Mormons have a few standard solutions to this problem:

- **Rely on your testimony of the priesthood leader himself.** In other words, ask God for confirmation that the leader is really called of God, and is receiving revelation for you. If the vehicle can be trusted, then the content can also be trusted. Another similar approach is to try and gain a witness from God that the Book of Mormon is true, or that Joseph Smith was a prophet. If either of these things are true, goes the argument, then everything about Mormonism is true, and you can trust the revelations that your priesthood leader receives for you.
- **Table the issue and remember that everything will make sense in the end.** I received this advice often. I’d express skepticism, and I would be told that it is common to have doubts and questions, but we should trust that everything will make sense in the end. God will make everything right.
- **Doubt your doubts.** This one seems helpful at first, placing doubts at the same level as beliefs and telling you to doubt your doubts instead of beliefs. But it quickly becomes absurd when you realize that it makes no sense to doubt your doubt and stop there — why not also doubt the doubting of your doubts, etc.? In the end, this solution amounts to a suggestion to simply stop doubting.

As an homage to the church that helped make me into the man I am, and as an exercise in creatively discovering the shape of my own moral self, I decided it would be fun to try and come up with my own personal 13 articles of faith. Here are some rules I tried to follow as I made my list:

- If a belief is logically entailed by another belief on your list, only list the logically prior belief.
- Categorize your beliefs as epistemology, metaphysics, phenomenology, ethics, or spirituality.
- Keep it to 13.

### My personal articles of faith

1. **Epistemology: I believe in a hierarchical coherentism.** I believe that beliefs are justified by the degree to which they contribute to the integrity of a full system of beliefs. And I believe in a hierarchy of systems, ordered by levels of abstraction. A belief may be justified by its internal consistency while existing in a system that itself is not justifiable within a larger system.
2. **Epistemology: I believe that most of our conscious, articulated beliefs are devices to provide support to instincts, behaviors, and ways of seeing the world that we do not choose, but that we find ourselves with.**
3. **Metaphysics: I believe that everything that exists is either matter/energy or an emergent property of material interactions.**I tend toward a materialist view of the universe. I don’t believe everything can be *reduced* to a material description, but I do believe that everything can (or will) be *explained* by material descriptions. As a neuroscientist, I can confidently say that we are not close to a complete mechanistic description of most simple behaviors, let alone the most complex psychological phenomena that we experience. But one of the beautiful features of the scientific enterprise is that, after engaging with it for some time, you start to realize that it is a massive web of knowledge, with all the strands depending on each other to some degree. You see theories come and go, but the web just keeps getting stronger. A new strand is discovered, and it connects multiple other strands that used to be separate. Eventually, nd the gaps in the web (i.e., things we don’t currently have a good scientific theory for) But for me, to believe otherwise (e.g., that psychological phenomena are caused by an immaterial soul) would require a massive shift in my web of belief. Having said this, I do think that all description cannot be reduced to a lower level without some loss of information.There is metaphysical reducibility, and there is existential reducibility. Metaphysically speaking, everything is reducible to a lower level of description. Why? Because, metaphysically speaking, our boundaries between levels of description are arbitrary and dependent upon the accidents of human cognition and the technologies we use to intervene with nature at various scales. Matter and energy don’t make a distinction between Existentially speaking, something is lost when we move from one level of description to another. Why? Because our descriptions are dependent on our models of how things behave at different scales. Is this just saying that we have bad models, though?
4. **Phenomenology: I believe humans have not just one self, but many selves.** I think claims about the self are phenomenological claims, not metaphysical claims. I simply think it is a better description of our experience to say that we each have an ecosystem of selves rather than just one self. Each individual self is made up of a need and a skill for satisfying that need. For example, one self might be These selves “compete”, and the dominant self at any given time is the skill that most effectively satisfies the most pressing need. In this view, the self that we experience as a single, unitary self over time is a narrative construction that driven by our need to see (and therefore skill in seeing) others as unitary selves.
5. **Ethics: I believe in consequentialism.** I believe the moral status of an act depends on the consequences that follow it and whether those consequences reduce suffering and increase the flourishing of life, both human and non-human. And because of my coherentism, I believe that the moral status of any act (and its consequences) is revisable if the system it exists in changes enough; something that is morally good or neutral now may be morally evil in the future, or maybe was evil in the past.
6. **Ethics: I believe we should take full moral responsibility not only for our actions, but also for our beliefs.** This means that you have to choose them. It is *really hard* to choose your beliefs authentically when you are given a set of beliefs that you must espouse in order to remain a member of a group you want to be in.
7. **Ethics: I believe that behavior is a more important moral dimension than belief is.**I do believe that belief can have a causal influence over behavior, but I also believe that behavior can have a causal influence over belief. Like most of our phenomena, there is an important circularity between belief and behavior. In the end, though, it is our behavior that we should seek to control and manage, whether by belief or by other devices. Our beliefs are embodied only by our behavior. Behavior is the embodiment of many things beside our belief, including our genetics. But is there a way to manage behavior if not through belief? Well, we act counter to our own beliefs all the time. In the competition to influence behavior, beliefs are up against some ancient, powerful competition: emotions, social positioning, rationality, etc. Any of these may pressure us to act counter to our beliefs. But can we change our behavior through these channels? I believe so. 
8. **Ethics: I believe that there is a circular interaction between collective and personal levels of morality.** Morality is a dynamical system between personal and collective levels of morality. The development of and adherence to a collective morality constructs and maintains an integral society, while adherence to personal morality constructs and maintains an integral self. We have mechanisms for regulating morality at the individual and collective level, and these interact intersubjectively. The individual level of morality is, arguably, just a uniquely filtered version of the collective conversation about morality. And the collective conversation about morality is simply made up of a bunch of different moral sentiments from individuals. I believe our choice of an ethical system or a belief system is an empirical process of sampling our environment and aligning with a group. I don’t think this is escapable. We can get tricky and flexible with this process, mixing and matching across different groups, but ultimately no belief gains justification outside of social indexing. The entire project of staking out a belief in explicit terms is a social project. We are differentiating ourselves vis a vis other humans and their commitments.
9. **Ethics: I believe that the expansion of our capacity for different kinds of experience is morally virtuous.**What is it like to be homeless? What is it like to be black in America? What is it like to be a gay teen growing up the LDS church? What is it like to be an immigrant fleeing from genocide in your home country? What is it like to take LSD? What is it like to be addicted to something? To answer these questions fully, you must partake in the experience yourself. But I can’t snap my fingers and change my race or sexual orientation, and I probably shouldn’t intentionally become addicted to something. Honing moral sentiments requires experience, but this experience cannot be direct in many cases. It might be spiritually virtuous to obey a rule out of deference to authority, whether that authority is God himself or a representative of God, but it is not morally virtuous. Obedience without experience is a moral good if it leads to behavior that aligns with the collective morality, but the credit for that moral good goes to the authority. The obedient person doesn’t build a stronger sense of moral right and wrong; he builds a stronger relationship with (and dependence on) the authority he is obeying. Therefore, seeking new experience is a prerequisite to continued moral development. By extension, it is morally virtuous to seek new experience, and morally reprehensible to avoid new experiences that could potentially result in further moral development. I certainly don’t want to argue that it is always morally virtuous to seek any kind of experience. I don’t know what it is like to murder someone, and it wouldn’t be virtuous of me to find out for myself if murder is good or bad. Or would it? Some murder could be considered morally good, such as in war, or when it involves protecting the innocent from aggressors. I think the difference is in the question: does this experience have the potential to be morally virtuous? How do we answer this question? Is it justifiable in a secular setting?
10. **Spirituality: I believe that spirituality is a set of skills for satisfying our need to escape the exhausting project of weaving all of our contradictory selves into a coherent, unitary self that is socially validated.** The more our selves are at odds, the harder it is to weave that autobiographical narrative. The harder it is to weave that narrative, the greater our need for spirituality. Religion tends to increase the tension between different selves (e.g., the Fall, pitting the spiritual against the physical aspects of humans, constant self-examination and comparison against an impossible standard in order to increase a sense of sinfulness), which creates a greater need for spirituality. Religion creates a quick, temporary patch (repentance, divine forgiveness) in return for the amplification of anxiety that it creates.

If you are free from suffering, it is a moral imperative to seek out the suffering of others, understand it, taste it, empathize with it, and share it (if not eliminate it).
