This is not an essay about religion. It is about *apostasy*, a historically religious term I have every intention of redefining before the essay is done. More broadly, this is an essay about leaving. It’s about (1) why we leave, (2) what exactly we are leaving when we leave, and (3) what comes after leaving.

I do focus on the paradigmatic experience of leaving a religion, mostly because I left Mormonism in 2017 after 38 years of faithful membership, and, as a relatively fresh apostate, I still have some processing to do. I suspect I will have processing to do for a very long time. For everyone other than me, this is certainly a timely topic given the [consistent trending away from religion](https://www.pewforum.org/2010/02/17/religion-among-the-millennials/) that we have been observing in western culture for several generations. So, yes, I'll be using religious apostasy as my base case. But nearly everything I say applies beyond religion to the experience of leaving relationships, affiliations, and systems that are no longer working for us. Each of us will eventually find ourselves in situations where apostasy is the best way forward.

For people whose lives have been touched by religion, the label of *apostate* isn't typically something that one aspires to. Aside from the bummer post-mortal implications ranging from endless torture to an impotent regret, apostasy triggers nontrivial social penalties due to the pervasive sense that apostates have betrayed not just God and themselves, but also their friends and family who still believe. 

For both the apostates and the people who are left behind, it is easy to misunderstand what motivates someone to leave their religion. As a result, recent apostates often feel like strangers and foreigners in their own worlds. To make matters worse, people who leave their religion are often unprepared for the task of finding meaning in a world where meaning isn’t tied down by a religion and their identity within it, and where truth isn’t fixed and coming from a single source outside of themselves. Indeed, it is not a big leap from that experience to the experience of leaving a marriage—coincidentally, something else I did in 2017—and suddenly becoming aware of just how extensively your sense of self was symbiotic with that relationship. After you are no longer "loving spouse of (randomspousename)" or "faithful member of the (randomreligion) community", what exactly are you? 



### 1. Why do we leave?



### 2. What are we leaving when we leave?



### 3. What comes after leaving?







When someone leaves a religion, their motivations cannot be reduced down to a single motivation. Religions that use the word _apostasy_ are typically religions that have such intense gravity that it is only after a multiplicity of motives have accumulated that there is sufficient force to escape the orbit of that religion. Here are just a few common reasons for leaving:

-   Your religion is harmful; you feel safer elsewhere.
-   You disagree with the doctrines; you find more alignment with a different system of beliefs.
-   You don’t like the culture; you are drawn to a different culture.
-   You find the experience shallow or limiting; you want to experience other ways of being in the world. 

Each item in this incomplete list is structured to acknowledge that we can be _pushed_ or _pulled_ out of our religion. Compelling critiques of religion are hard to avoid in our digital information economy, and this means most apostates are feeling a healthy outward push. 

  

  

**Every act of apostasy is a significant shift in the self. It is an advertisement of instability, and as such, it is a dangerous thing to do.** 

The “self” is a problematic term. It can be used to refer to nearly any process by which an organism seeks, retains, and uses information that distinguishes the organism from its environment. 

One particular referent of the term self is the “autobiographical narrative self” (come up with a better name?), which consists of (1) the declarative memories that we are capable of recalling, and (2) the roles we have assigned to those memories in order to deploy them as a model for navigating social dynamics. The model helps us navigate in two important ways: (1) helping us decide what we want by attempting to capture and perpetuate patterns in our history of decisions, and (2) by virtue of its socially relevant attributes, locating us in a complex social hierarchy through differentiation and alignment.

Sometimes we are asked to justify a single action. If that was the only demand we ever encountered, we could simply leverage our memory of past actions and say that it is a statistical pattern. But more often, we are asked to justify the pattern itself. “Why did you do that?” The answer cannot be, “Because my past behavior predicts it.” A satisfactory justification will say something about a model that is composed of motivations and drives and rules. Because ultimately, most questions about our behavior are usually questions about why we violated an expectation, and expectations can lazily be informed by rules in the absence of other information.

  

  

The autobiographical self is the fictional hidden cause.

The autobiographical self is problematic. Why? 

Are we becoming more obsessed with the autobiographical self over time? Is it becoming more of a thing? See [here](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=%22+the+self+%22&year_start=1800&year_end=2019&corpus=26&smoothing=2). We no longer live provincial lives where the sphere of our regular interactions is limited to the village. We now must keep tabs on hundreds of relationships and what parts of our fiction we have shown in those relationships.

Consider the act of lying. When we lie, the only way for the lie to succeed is for us to remember the lie and everyone who knows about it; if we fail to remember, we risk saying something that betrays the lie. The bigger the lie, the more the liar becomes obsessed with and ultimately defined by the lie. 

  

#### The management of the self

But it is essential that we also _find the pull._

But wait. Is it truly essential to be pulled out of our religion by something else? What’s wrong with leaving simply because the negative features of our religion have become more salient to us than the positive ones?

There is an underlying premise here. Attachment versus detachment as the way to satisfy our need. I’m not going to spend much time defending this, so if you disagree, you’ll probably find the rest of the essay a bit annoying.

Ultimately, I will argue that attachment and detachment solve the problem of the self in different ways. 

**Attachment** is a way of tuning the bias-variance tradeoff of our model of the world. If we are overly attached, we are too biased and our model of the world will not take into account important evidence. If we are not attached enough, our model of the world will overfit to our small sample of the evidence. Attachment is a way of giving a shape to sparse evidence. It is the choice of a strong, narrow prior, in bayesian terms. Aside from the bias/variance axis, attachment also varies in the motivations that drive it, which are determined by the needs that it is satisfying. Are there any rules to follow when it comes to assessing which needs are healthy drivers of attachment and which needs are unhealthy? Also, attachment will always result in evidence conforming to the prior. In deciding how strong the prior should be, one needs to weigh the costs of missing important evidence that contradicts the prior. 

**Detachment**, done correctly, is a way of practicing a full awareness and acceptance that the model (i.e., the self) is a necessary fiction. It is not a refusal to commit to anything. 

If we do them in a healthy way, attachment and detachment are not aiming at the same targets. Healthy attachment roots us in ways of living that connect us to features of the world that nourish us by directly satisfying fundamental needs. Attachment needs to be pointed toward things that resist us, that ask us to change, that have a clear and consistent identity. It is vital that the things we attach to do not simply become a mirror of ourselves. We can do all of this and still practice detachment, because healthy detachment is not a mandate to stop attaching, but rather to decouple the objects of our attachment from any sense of ownership, entitlement, or expectation. Detachment converts attachment into gratitude and hope, and forces our attachment to stay in the present. I can be attached to my wife by relishing her now. There is no need to go beyond now. We can still make plans and hope that they happen. And I can enjoy that expectation now, in the moment.

If we focus our apostasy solely on the negation of our religious experience and commitments, we might successfully silence a major source of dissonance. If quiet is all we seek, negation alone might work just fine. If we want to rediscover the music of our selfhood, we also need to find what is pulling us. 

#### Balancing Faith and Good Faith

A healthy self depends on identifying both the pushing and the pulling forces in our lives. As we solidify our sense of what we will not allow in our lives, we develop clear boundaries. And as we flesh out the shape of what we need and desire in our lives, we become more substantial, more alive. We need to negate and we need to assert. We need skepticism and we need belief. 

One of my favorite descriptions of this balance comes from the French existentialist Maurice Merleau-Ponty, who talks about it in terms of “faith” (i.e., commitment regardless of evidence) and “good faith” (i.e., only saying what is allowed by evidence). 

> “Man’s value does not consist in either an explosive, maniac sincerity or an unquestioned faith. Instead, it consists of a higher awareness which enables him to determine the moment when it is reasonable to take things on trust and the moment when questioning is in order, to combine faith and good faith within himself” (Merleau-Ponty, “Faith and Good Faith” 179).

The experience of apostasy can engender a sort of hypersensitivity to the dangers of faith. For the apostate, the memory of that faith is still fresh, and it can be a terrifying thing to look back at the absolute certainty they had despite all the evidence that was always there, but only became visible when they started being honest with themselves. But the pendulum can swing too far. The skeptical sincerity that Merleau-Ponty points to can elicit its own powerful sort of intoxication. There is paradoxical power and safety to be found in a systematic questioning of everything, precisely because it so effectively justifies a lack of commitment to anything. Here is Merleau-Ponty again:

> “If sincerity is one’s highest value, one will never become fully committed to anything, not to a Church or to a party, not to a love or a friendship, not even to a particular task; for commitment always assumes that one’s affirmation surpasses one’s knowledge, that one believes by hearsay, that one gives up the rule of sincerity for that of responsibility” (Ibid 179).

A healthy apostasy will not succumb to the temptation to assume that all faith is bad faith, but will go on to find things to believe in. It can be hard to conceive of apostasy in this way, primarily because apostates often cede the narrative advantage to the religious community they are leaving. Like any other groups, religions don’t like to be left. The ones leaving are apostates, heretics, and infidels. These can be powerful labels, and it probably doesn’t make sense to question how they are defined within the communities where they originated. But as you are on your way out of the community, it isn’t unfair to take some etymological liberties and find a more generous narrative around your apostasy.

#### Models of apostasy

The word “apostasy” derives from the greek _apostasis,_ which literally means “a standing off” or “standing away”. It certainly makes room for an aggressive interpretation, like a rebellion or defection. And it is true that, for some people, apostasy is a rebellion from what they perceive to be a powerful and manipulative institution. But even for the people whose apostasy has gentler tones, the original greek carries a more active and volitional connotation than what you find in many Christian communities, where apostasy is paternalistically defined as a passive _falling away_ (this comes from 2 Thessalonians 2:3, where the original greek _apostosia_ is sometimes translated as “a falling away”). The difference between _standing_ and _falling_ is important, and the discourse around disagreeing with your religion is polarized by this difference.

_Falling away_ requires something to fall from — a standard, a truth, a community. It implies that apostasy happens not because you have a different, justifiable belief, but because you suddenly lack belief. This discourse is reinforced when the religious community has beliefs that either explicitly rule out or indirectly inhibit the ability to imagine other ways of finding truth and being good. When people apostatize from religious communities like this, they are prone to feeling stripped bare, empty, hollowed — even if they do have some well-reasoned beliefs that simply couldn’t fit within their religion. Part of the reason for this is that many religions curb the voicing of beliefs that are contrary to canon. You can have your doubts and your contradictory beliefs, but you can’t talk about them. Consequently, when someone leaves, the perceived cause will generally center on an absence of either belief or moral strength. This is the **Deficiency Model** of apostasy.

The _standing away_ interpretation of apostasy implies a certain boldness and courage. Standing is an active differentiation of oneself, a signal that you are staking out a position. It opens the door for a model of apostasy that doesn’t see divergence as deficient. Let’s call it the **Abundance Model** of apostasy. In this model, apostasy happens not because the apostate lacks something that is required, but because the apostate possesses something that doesn’t fit. It’s not that your belief is absent, it is that there is too much of it; it overflows past the boundaries of truth and goodness that the religion has established.

And just as the Deficiency Model of apostasy goes hand in hand with an impoverished view of the alternatives for finding truth and goodness outside of the religion, the Abundance Model becomes an option only to the extent that those alternatives become visible. It is an exhilarating experience to realize that you can believe _whatever feels right;_ you can learn to rely more fully on your own sense of right and wrong rather than reflexively aligning with an external authority. You can believe anything you want, and there are so many things out there that want to be believed. 

Of course, it is not a trivial thing to transcend the psychological framing of the communities and belief systems that shape us into who we are. The forces that push and pull us out of a religion may be acting on us long before we can give them a name. And even when the names start to arrive, the forces compelling us to leave are contending against powerful and complex forces that are pushing and pulling us back into the religion.

We should think carefully about what those forces are acting against. If they are dislodging us, _what exactly has been doing the lodging?_

  

  

  

Abundance. Faith. The pulling forces in our lives. These are all different facets of discovering and taking responsibility for who we are. But how do we do that? Well, I think in order to do that, we need to understand the forces that make it hard to do, and what needs to happen in order to overcome those forces. In other words, how do we change? (1) how do I find a new community? (2) how do I build new beliefs?]

  

  

### _2. What are we leaving?_

Make the point that what we are leaving behind is not just the obvious stuff (beliefs, social groups, etc.). We are also leaving behind a commitment, and there should absolutely be some intense gravity to overcome here. Regardless of who we’ve committed to and how they’ll react to us leaving, and regardless of what beliefs we have to change and how our web of belief will be perturbed, the fact remains that we are stepping away from a commitment, and this has the potential to erode our confidence in our ability to make commitments. 

Central question here is, how do graphs behave when they are perturbed?

#### We are Nodes in Networks

  

I’m going to keep coming back to the idea of a graph, or a web. Think of a bunch of distinct, interconnected points, or _nodes_. Some nodes might exist on the outskirts of the graph, with only a few weak connections. Other nodes might be closer to the center, with thousands of well-reinforced connections to other nodes. 

Think of a family tree. 

A religion is a graph 

  

#### We are networks

  

We model internally the external networks that we are part of. The external reality of our membership within those networks does not always align with the internal model of our membership. We might belong to a community and have real relationships there, all while not considering ourselves part of the community because we secretly know that we don’t meet the requirements of membership in the community. Conversely, we may internally identify with a community long after leaving or being expelled from that community. 

#### The Web of Belief

Consider this short list of statements:

-   I love my wife and my children. 
-   10\*10 = 100. 
-   Genocide is evil. 
-   Los Angeles is a city in California.
-   I am capable of reaching out and grabbing the coffee cup in front of me.
-   Bagpipes do not biologically reproduce and give birth to baby bagpipes.

I am absolutely certain that each of these statements is true. Notice that they each require a different kind of evidence. In one case, the evidence might be a compelling emotion. In another, it might be a map, or a mathematical proof, or a rich set of memories.

Aside from different kinds of evidence, these statements also differ in how the experience of certainty is fleshed out in practical terms. In some cases, the certainty means, “I am willing to risk my own credibility to say that this statement is true.” In this category, we find the types of statements that carve out the boundaries of the self because it is a type of statement that will differentiate us from others (usually by aligning us with one group out of many possible groups — even the most extreme individualists have a hard time not seeing themselves as a type of something, even if that type is _individualist_). In other cases, the certainty means, “I am not willing to risk my own credibility to say that this statement is not true.” The statements in this category are most often trivially true statements that most people wouldn’t bother taking a position on, other than to avoid sounding insane when the question is posed to them (e.g., “Los Angeles ” or “Baby bagpipes”). 

In every case, the degree of certainty regarding a statement is a function of how much other beliefs (and the needs that those beliefs satisfy) would be destabilized if the statement were not true. Critically, the potential impact of this counterfactual destabilization also determines the degree to which evidence even matters.

### 3. What comes after leaving?
