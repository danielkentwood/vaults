# **EDIFICATION**

**PRINCIPLES**

**The Hermeneutic Circle:** This will be the core idea, so you need to figure out a simple way of explaining it. See illustration below. The meaning of my life is determined by my interpretation of the totality of my experiences. But the meaning of these experiences changes as I re-evaluate them according to the ever-changing understanding of my entire life. Some memories are so painful that they seem to coerce us into interpreting our lives in a negative way--we are forced into negative narratives. The atonement is something that can legitimize an alternative interpretation of that memory, and therefore alter the global interpretation of one's life. The atonement helps us climb up the hermeneutic ladder, instead of sliding down it.

Due to the circular nature of faith (we can only have faith in spiritual evidence, but spiritual evidence only comes through faith), we have to jump right in and begin acting "as if" we had faith. We exercise a desire to believe, a desire to be in that circle. This process of faking it is what introduces us into the circle. First get the behaviour down, and the body will then be receptive to the feelings and experiences that lead to a genuine, authentic motivation for the behaviour.

More on this circle: D&C 68:29. The language of "keeping the sabbath day holy". The day is a holy day, yes. But we keep it holy, we maintain its holiness by doing certain holy things. So here is the circle. We do holy things on the sabbath because it is a holy day. But it is a holy day because we do holy things. This same circularity applies to the temple. In D&C 117:16, the same language is used: "Remember the Lord their God, and mine also, to keep and preserve it holy." See also D&C 94:8-9 and D&C 97:16-17. The holiness of the temple is dependent upon what we do there, and what is allowed to enter. But what we do there (i.e., holy things) is dictated by the fact that it is a holy place. Alma 32 shows us that people become holy and full of faith in the same way that objects, places, and days become holy. This is an insight that informs how we interact with other people. The notion of edification, in particular.

All this leads to Kierkegaard's beautiful idea of love as presupposing love in others. By loving them--that is, by presupposing love in them--we throw them into a narrative where they are loving and loveable. The one consistent truth about our situation at any given time is that it is always already there for us; it appears that we have always been loving when someone presupposes love in us. Thus, the person who loves pulls the beloved into the circle, into the narrative where they are loving people. This is edification: the process of changing someone's narrative into one that helps them reach higher and be better.

And since the HG largely works by altering our narrative and making all things new, it is easy to see how the HG is often included in scriptural discussions of edification.

**Faith, hope, love:** These are all god-shaped filters. Faith is a god-shaped filter for how to perceive god and his powers and potential. Hope is a god-shaped filter for how to see yourself and your powers and potential. Love is a god-shaped filter for how to see others and their powers and potential.

**Feedback cycles:** How the hermeneutic circle results in downward and upward spirals in our affections, our behaviours, our faith, and our skills.

**Recursive Development of Will (aka The Recursive Development of Narrative Identity):** Our ability to exercise will power is, paradoxically, largely a function of how well we've exercised it in the past. A history of selecting immediate rewards that conflict with our moral code will result in a weak will. Our goal should be to build up a history of successful exertion of will over immediacy (when these are in conflict). Why is this the case? Because building up a history of success validates and makes believable a story about ourselves in which we are powerful, temperate, and honest with ourselves. This is an instance of the hermeneutic circle.

**The "Because I Said So" Principle:** eventually, we have to get to the point where we highly value the commitments that we have made, even if those commitments were made long ago and don't seem to apply in the present moment. If we need to re-evaluate the commitment, we can do that later, but not while we're under the influence of an urge, emotion, or feeling that tells us to break that commitment. We have to behave in a certain way for no reason other than that we once said we would. In those moments where it seems absurd to continue following the commitment, we MUST remember that we are keeping the commitment not simply for the sake of the commitment, but also for the sake of developing and maintain our ability to keep commitments in general. To help deal with those conflicts between commitment and immediate urges, we must treat ourselves dialectically (this is, essentially, the ability to reason by way of a set of assumptions--or a way of life--different than one's own). A sense of appreciation for the power of a situation or a passing mood to determine our reasoning and our non-thematic behaviour. This implies that, in a very important sense, we are not the same people (or, at least, not reasoning with the same set of assumptions) from one moment to the next.

**Narrative Contagion:** Almost all roles are social, collusive. Treating someone in a particular way (i.e., motivated by a particular narrative about that person and your relationship with him or her) invites them to join with you in that role. "Pulling" a role out of someone (e.g., Nephi asking Lehi where to go to find food).

**Indirect Communication (maieutic):** The most ineffective way of getting people to act in a certain role is to tell them to act in that role. Example: If I blame someone for repeatedly hurting my feelings, there are a number of ways to react. Most of them involve some sort of punitive course of action, where the offender is brought to justice or at least faced with the consequences of his actions. The problem is that, almost without exception, this course tends to entrench people in the role that they were playing when they hurt my feelings. They have been either explicitly or implicitly labeled as a hurtful person, and they therefore have to contend with this label (usually without realizing that they are contending with it, and therefore more than likely to continue in it). Telling someone to shape up, repeatedly harping on them, is a surefire way to cement them into a negative feedback cycle. Ironically, often the only way to break someone out of their negative cycle (of offensive behaviour, in this case) is to launch a labelling campaign in which you (1) treat them as if they have already stopped the behaviour and are engaging in the opposite/desired behaviour, (2) compliment them on their desired behaviour and, better yet, let them find out that you have complimented them behind their backs, (3) recruit others to either label them positively or label them negatively while you (or someone else) convincingly defends them and positively labels them in the process. The most powerful cue is when someone finds out something on their own. Magicians know this. *Nothing convinces you more than the story you tell yourself.* Plant evidence that they are already doing a wonderful job filling this narrative role, and that it is rewarding for them to do so. The Holy Ghost is the ultimate edifier for this reason. It has the ability to teach us through our own thoughts and feelings, and thus the narratives that are given to us through the Holy Ghost are also, in an important sense, self-generated. And this somehow solidifies these narratives than if they had been received from an external source.

**Socratic irony:** Feigning ignorance to bring out the latent knowledge within others. Posing as needy in order bring out the compassion within others. Midwifery.

**Kierkegaardian Like-for-Like:** We are only loving to the extent that we see others as loving. We are only hateful and inhumane to the degree that we presuppose others are acting with these motivations. Presupposing love in others builds love within them. We only invite the respect that we have for ourselves, and we are only respectful to the degree that we see others as respectful. This is a form of indirect communication.

**Good cop, bad cop:** Creating a situation where someone joins with you in a specific storyline intervention in which one person asserts the stereotypical, negative storyline and the other person corrects him or her with a positive storyline.

**Enumeration of specific narratives:**  Dominant narratives in the ideal LDS life. Self control. Control over the flesh. Ability to keep covenants and promises in the face of temptation and uncertainty. Charity and selflessness. Loss of self in general. (There is an immense tension between the narratives of self-control and self-eradication in LDS thought and culture. Ever since encountering Kierkegaard, my life has been an explicit struggle between these two narratives.). Priests and priestesses, kings and queens, gods and goddesses. Adam and Eve, and the temple in general.

**Symbiotic narratives:** Narratives that can only exist between people, not in isolation. For example, being a man reaches the pinnacle of its meaning when you truly confront real womanhood. Put in other terms, masculinity can only be pulled out of a man by a woman. Similarly, femininity can only be pulled out of a woman by a man. Some of these symbiotic narratives can be unhealthy (Terry Warner calls this collusion): being angry requires you to believe that you are a victim and the person you are angry at is the villain.

Here is a coarse illustration of the hermeneutic circle:

Take the following sentence:

*I reached down.*

It is a complete thought, but only barely. Why did I reach down? Where am I while I am reaching down? Who is the "I" that is speaking here?

*I reached down and picked a flower.*

Ah, well that sheds a little more light, and it sounds so pleasant! Keep reading.

*I reached down and picked a flower. Sure enough, there was a tiny speck of blood on the stem. The grizzly had indeed come this way. "Follow me, and stay close," I said to the other two hunters and the half-dozen Japanese eco-tourists who were huddled behind me, their cold fingers rigid upon their ready cameras. "I've wounded him, and he isn't likely to be very happy about that." The group nodded in agreement. At length, we came upon a fir tree that had been clawed at. The marks were fresh. This didn't make sense, though. "Why would a grizzly take the time to claw at a tree when he was being pursued?" A man with a thick German accent replied: "Maybe you should ask the grizzly himself." I was saying to myself that I didn't remember any Germans being in the group, and that was precisely the moment when I realized that the grizzly bear was standing in the middle of the group, still speaking perfect English -- with a heavy German accent, of course. "He's anxious to meet you all, ja?" The bone-rattling germanic roar of the Grizzly mingled with confused camera clicks and eco-tourist screams, and that is the last thing I remember before waking up in my hammock on a hot, hazy Jamaican afternoon. What a dream. I forgot to mention that I'm Jamaican.*

Now go back and read the first couple sentences. Did they mean something slightly different the first time you read them? That is because you were reading them with a much different background story. At that point, they *were* the background story. Conversely, if you started with the last sentence first ("I forgot to mention that I'm Jamaican."), you would understand the sentence at a basic level, but it would have a slightly different meaning after having read the rest of the story. This is the hermeneutic circle. We can only understand a story insofar as we understand the little pieces that make up the story. But our understanding of those little pieces is also dependent upon our understanding of the entire story. Another way of putting this is that the scenes determine the meaning of the story, but the story, once understood, retroactively determines the meaning of the scenes. But wait: since these scenes now have a new meaning, the story also has a new meaning. And the circle continues.

Have you ever read a novel for the second time and it felt like a completely different novel? Exactly.

*Face to Face*

Consider the difficulties God faces in communicating with us. Let's start with the most obvious difficulty: the lack of a regular face-to-face encounter. One of the earliest forms of human communication is through facial expression. Long before an infant develops language skills, she is speaking and understanding volumes with her face: a smile, an eye fixation, a crinkling of the brow, etc. This can happen at such an early stage because the human brain has developed specialized networks for perceiving and making sense of faces. If these brain networks are damaged in a person, he will have a disorder called *prosopagnosia*, which is basically an ability to see everything except for people's faces. This special "face network" in the brain developed hand in hand with the social importance of the face for the survival of the individual. We tend to distrust people who refuse to show their face; it is almost as if there is a sense that the face generally speaks the truth even when there is an intent to deceive. Perhaps this is why, of all the physical qualities of a person's body, the appearance of the face is typically the one that is most synonymous with that person's identity. And yet God rarely shows his face. We don't have the benefit of seeing the smile or the tears of God. This is a major disadvantage.

*The Inadequacy of Language*

Another communicatory hurdle for God is the inadequacy of language. Anyone who speaks more than one language has encountered situations where there is no perfect translation from one language to another. When this happens, the best we can do is approximate the meaning of the original expression, but something important is still lost. These semantic gaps would seem to pose a significant problem for a God who wants to express the same message to everyone in perfect clarity -- and in their own tongue. The root of the problem here is that different languages arise out of different background practices and ways of living. Even if someone were to learn every German word, it is impossible to express oneself truly and properly in German unless one experiences the culture from which German sprang. So the little gaps in meaning between the various languages of the world can be attributed to the lack of a shared background between the cultures that gave rise to the languages. And this points to perhaps an even more problematic issue with language: our lack of shared background with God. Even if he perfectly understands us and our background, we are somewhat blind to his. Even the scattered glimpses that we get from ancient and contemporary revelation are, essentially, translations from God's language to the language of the prophet who is receiving the revelation (and, more often than not, another translation from the prophet's language to our own). On its own, language is inadequate to the task of clear, unambiguous communication between God and his children.

*????*

When two people communicate, implicit rules govern not only the things they say, but also the things they don't say. In other words, silence is another way of communicating. I think we often run into communication problems with God because of our expectation that he will follow mortal conventions that govern the timing of conversation. Another way of saying this is that conversations with God are typically two-way monologues; I speak for awhile and then God speaks for awhile.

D&C 1:24 Behold, I am God and have spoken it; these commandments are of me, and were given unto my servants in their weakness, after the manner of their language, that they might come to understanding.

So, to sum things up. God has to communicate with us in a language that will not perfectly convey what he means, on a timescale that we're not accustomed to, and at a distance that rules out non-verbal gestures.

truth and edification as examples of God reappropriating our language.

Language. God takes the raw materials of our language and does what he can with it.

God is often dissatisfied with these materials, however, and he doesn't feel compelled to obey every linguistic convention. He often uses words in peculiar ways, slightly transforming their meaning to presumably convey a more effective message to us.

Edification is the word that God has chosen to appropriate as a description of the process by which these impediments to communication can be overcome.

Remember, there are techniques for "story editing" but even these are flimsy substitutes for the presence of the HG. When we use techniques without the HG, we are still playing a relatively large role in bringing about the change. When HG is present, individuals truly feel ownership over noble sentiments and motives, attributing such to their own agency or to god.

**Edifying those who are antagonistic toward the church.**

"The weak and the unlearned of the world". Compare this with the perception of the world (and many within the church) that it is predominantly the poor and uneducated that cling to religion. It occurs to me that it is wrong to resist this interpretation. It may be difficult to identify oneself as weak and unlearned, especially if your profession is in the field of education. BUT we can take an ironic pose and proclaim boldly our own ignorance, and the ignorance of those who embrace religion. We simply need to have a response to the criticism that ignorance is dangerous. Answer: there are many types of ignorance, and who is to say what kind of ignorance is most dangerous?

[Consider any vital moral issues where God and secular wisdom part ways: abortion, homosexuality, marriage, recreational drug consumption, etc. Would your position be different if God was not in the picture? If not, then what significance does a belief in God actually have? If so, then you are unable to consider yourself part of secular society--your position is based upon assumptions that the rest of the group cannot share.]

I'm coming to hold the position that Church and State must be divided not only in policy but also in our individual approach toward policy. For example, if I hold that homosexuality is a sin, it is still wrong for me to try and legislate that belief because it is a belief that is based upon an idiosyncratic, non-demonstrable foundation, and legislation should assume to protect the rights of all, especially the minority, under assumptions that all can share because they are scientifically grounded.

The most effective argument against religion:

"Those who can make you believe absurdities can make you commit atrocities."

Voltaire

Absurd, illogical, irrational, nonsensical, unreasonable

Any definition of the absurd must be secular in order to be productive (we need a common language). Any secular definition of the absurd is likely to be based upon scientific notions.

**Problem-solving**

Resist the urge to solve people's problems when counselling and edifying. Don't rob them of their conflict! Rather, orient them and give them the tools and motivation they need to overcome the conflict.

**The Experience of Edification**

Role of the HG and Spirit.

The "renewal" of the HG. One of the roles of the HG is to, along with the Atonement, change our narratives about ourselves. It does this by providing new context (i.e., light) to our situation. All things are become new.

**The experiment**

As a scientist, one of my favourite passages of scripture is Alma 32. The entire chapter is a detailed description of a personal 'experiment' that is designed to test the reality of spiritual things. It is a beautiful and simple picture of how faith develops.

**Edifying your spouse**

This is perhaps the most important idea. It deals with the most important relationship, and it has to overcome the most entrenched negative feelings, the most crystallized negative feedback loops, etc.

This should be your goal for the next . . . well, until you get it right, really. No need to move on to anything else if you can't learn how to edify and upbuild your own spouse.

First, you start with a vision of who your spouse is and/or can be. This can be an extremely explicit, detailed vision, or it can be based upon a strong yet poorly articulated emotion. As long as this vision is fertile, it will do. (Although the most fecund visions seem to be those that are rooted in a strong emotion and a core narrative.)

Next, you find ways of communicating that vision to her. Not all forms of communication are equally effective here. The most effective form, it seems, is the subtle redirection of a narrative. This is a type of indirect communication. Another indirect form is maieutic communication. This practice actively (although tacitly) tries to draw out of the individual truths or narratives about herself that are compatible with the vision.

One of the most important opportunities for this is during disagreements, etc.

Faith as acting "as if". Presupposing this vision is already true of your spouse. Link between faith and love.

Our narratives need conflict. Unfortunately, we too often make our spouse the villain and the target of that conflict in our narrative. The goal is to team up with the spouse against a common foe, a common obstacle, a common hardship or trial. Your spouse isn't the enemy; poverty is the enemy. Lack of sleep and/or poor health is the enemy. Raising a child well is the challenge. etc.

**This hints at a general process:**

(1) Capture/cultivate a vision of who the person is and can become. See them as you would like them to be, or even better, see them as they themselves would like to be (which requires getting to know them well and understanding their greatest desires, which are most often unspoken and sometimes even unrecognized). Guard your own thoughts and emotions and ideas so that if you are tempted to think of that person as they used to be (someone with less faith might say, "as they currently are"), you can quickly dismiss that temptation and affirm that positive, loving vision once more. Don't make this harder than it needs to be. Everybody is, at their root, a good and decent person.

(2) Look for evidence that they are ALREADY this person. You will find it. And as you find it, you will be filled with love and admiration for this person and you will wonder how you didn't see it before.

(3) When you find that evidence, communicate it to them. The mode of communication is important. Indirect communication is the most powerful mode here.

(4) Even if they initially resist the way you are treating and describing them, if they truly desire to be this person then they will begin to see the same evidence that you are seeing. They will see more and more confirmations that they really are this kind of person, that they really can do the amazing things you are noticing.

LOVE IS A KIND OF FAITH.

Jacob 3:1-2

Integrate this with insights from Schnarch.

The concepts of fusion and differentiation.

Building ourselves by knowing and honoring ourselves.

**Edification and the priesthood**

Inviting others to work, and to return and report. Giving responsibility, which provides meaning and narrative structure. As priesthood leaders, we must not try to do everything ourselves, not only because of the danger of burnout, but also because we would be depriving others of opportunities for growth and joy through inhabiting a narrative role that comes pre-loaded with spiritual significance.

The art of delegation. Providing opportunities for growth that will not lead to burnout or frustration. An appropriate amount of ambiguity (for the individual) and difficulty. Clear expectations in terms of deadlines for returning and reporting. This is essential for working with the youth in the church. It is the essence of our increased focus upon developing youth leaders.

God trusting us with the priesthood--this simple act alone is a presupposition of integrity and righteousness. Alma 13 and D&C 84.

**The Edification of the Masses**

D&C 88:122 There is something important about the sense of equality when it comes to information commerce. If one person is set up as the source of information, it is more difficult to draw information (e.g., truth) out of someone else. If everybody feels equally valued and validated in their ability to contribute to the content of the encounter, edification is far more likely to occur.

So much of the work we do in the stake is effective marketing. This applies not to just stake work, but to all gospel teaching. It is rare to have a deep, complex personal study session with a large audience. In general, the lessons that are remembered are those that have the best marketing (not necessarily the most truth or the most depth). Your teaching needs to presuppose that others have already done their personal study, that they have a foundation of knowledge and experience that will allow them to both appreciate and pursue the well-formed and well-marketed message that you express. Think of Uchtdorf's forget-me-nots. Think of Hinckley's Six Be's (grateful, smart, clean, true, humble, prayerful).

David Sandor: he is constantly teaching lessons (stories, narratives) from the lives of the members, spreading understanding of how amazing the stake is. Always telling others about how good I am at doing certain things (while I am sitting right there) that I am not actually that good at.

Examples of Christ edifying/upbuilding others.

**Important: The Holy Ghost is the ultimate form of indirect communication. People gain insight and largely feel that they contributed to that insight. Scriptural injunctions to edify are, in effect, saying that we must avoid directly telling people what to do and think; rather we should invite the Holy Ghost and allow them to come to their own conclusions with their own questions. This presupposes more intelligence and love and spirituality from them, and thrusts them into the most important narrative, i.e., that they are children of God and capable of communing with him.**

[Need to begin with a section talking about stories and their power in our lives. Talk about the roles that we play, from smalltalk with strangers to major career decisions. Gender roles. Parental roles. Youth roles. Most labels (e.g., control-freak, nerd/genius, slob, etc.) and most professions (e.g., garbage man, professor, artist, coach, etc) come with built in scripts that make it easier for us to know how we should act, or rather how other people expect us to act. The need to confirm people's presuppositions about ourselves (or perhaps simply our idea of what other people would presuppose about us) is immense.]

[think about your experience in the temple. The endowment ceremony traces the story of Adam and Eve as they fall from their state of innocence and are gradually brought back into the presence of God through covenants that give them access to the atonement of Christ. Before this all begins, we are told to consider ourselves as if we were each, respectively, Adam or Eve. We become actors playing a role in the most important story of all, one that has taken place in other worlds throughout eternity.

[think about the language of "taking upon ourselves the name of christ." this is narrative language. taking upon ourselves a certain role, a certain narrative.]

The notion of contagion:

* Amable and Seneda.

* Planting confederates in a situation with a predetermined assignment, creating an atmosphere of participation and activity.

Our callings are roles. Important for leaders to build up the sacred and essential nature of each calling.

We must treat ourselves dialectically. A sense of appreciation for the power of a situation or a passing mood to determine our reasoning and our non-thematic behaviour.

The work of counselling is often a work of reframing situations, rather than solving people's problems. They must find the solutions on their own.

God never tells us to trust ourselves (Sandor), or even that He should trust us (unless the sealing power has been bestowed).

Sanctified by the reception of the Holy Ghost. Reception is a process, not an event. Change of heart through prolonged exposure to the Holy Ghost.

Lasting change does not derive from an understanding of behavior but rather from changes in ones narrative. Similar to packard's quote

Edification in the scriptures

The story of Christ assuming that Peter had the ability to walk on the water. It gave Peter enough faith to try it.

**Notes from Works of Love, Kierkegaard**

What you perhaps frequently had verified in lesser instances, that true upbuilding consists in being spoken to rigorously, you learned here in the deepest sense: that only this *shall* eternally and happily saves from despair.

If there is to be any talk of building up, then no matter how high or low the building becomes, the work must be *from the ground up.*

Thus, it is so very far from being the case that the upbuilding would be something that is an

*excellence*

of a few gifted individuals, similar to brains, literary talent, beauty, and the like (alas, this is just an unloving and divisive error!) that on the contrary it is the very opposite—every human being by his life, by his conduct, by his behavior in everyday affairs, by his association with his peers, by his words, his remarks, should and could build up and would do it if love is really present in him.

For ex- ample, when we see a solitary person managing by commendable frugality to get along thriftily with little, we honor and praise him, we are cheered, and we are confirmed in the good by this sight, but we do not actually say that it is an upbuilding sight. When, however, we see how a housewife, one who has many to care for, by means of frugality and wise thriftiness lovingly knows how to confer a blessing on the little so that there still is enough for all, we say that this is an upbuilding sight. The upbuilding consists in this, that we see the housewife’s loving solicitude at the same time as we see the fru- gality and thrift, which we honour.

To see the great artist finishing his masterpiece is a glorious and uplifting sight, but it is not upbuilding. Suppose this master- piece was a marvelous piece; if, now, the artist, out of love for a person, smashed it to pieces—then this sight would be upbuilding.

To build up is to build up love, and it is love that builds up.

*The one who loves presupposes that love is in the other person’s heart and by this very presupposition builds up love in him—from the ground up, provided, of course, that in love he presupposes its presence in the ground.*

Love builds up by presupposing that love is present in the ground; therefore love also builds up where, in the human sense, love seems to be lacking and where, in the human sense, it seems first and foremost necessary to tear down, yet not for the sake of desire but for the sake of salvation.

But when the one who loves builds up, it is the very opposite of tearing down, because the one who loves does something to himself—he presupposes that love is present in the other person—which certainly is the very opposite of doing something to the other person. To tear down satisfies the sensate person only all too eas- ily; to build up in the sense of doing something to the other person can also satisfy the sensate, but to build up by conquering oneself satisfies only love; yet this is the only way to build up.

Love is to presuppose love; to have love is to pre- suppose love in others; to be loving is to presuppose that others are loving.

If, however, someone were to think that he was loving, but also that all others were not loving, we would say: No, stop, here is a contradiction in the thought itself, because to be loving is to assume, to presuppose, that other people are loving.

Notes from "Redirect," by Timothy Wilson

- Changing narratives typically requires repetition over time. Often not possible without some form of reinforcement. Circumstances that elicit the positive or negative cycle: how frequent are they and was the narrative intervention salient enough to break into a positive cycle?
- Inception: We can be quite overt in spoon-feeding positive narratives to children, but we need to be more subtle with adults. Wilson refers to the latter as story prompting (p. 14)
- We develop theories about the causes of our feelings (p. 27). These tie into our narratives, and our feelings then feed off our narratives.
- Ambiguity:
    - increasing ambiguity magnifies impact of events (positive or negative)
    - reducing ambiguity blunts impact (p. 56, 60)
- Increasing gratitude, sense of renewal
    - Writing exercise using counterfactuals (p. 62, 63). Notion of semantic/narrative salience.
- Genetic influences of native optimism (p. 66)
- Elements of a good narrative/story ----> see "Story"
- Pennebaker writing exercise (p. 72)
- With children, conditional regard (+ or -) versus autonomy support (p. 84-85)
    - Threats and rewards should be as small as possible. Lasting effects of behaviour (p. 91)
- The need for motive attribution as an instance of the narrative drive (p. 93)
- Labeling. Primarily useful with children (p. 97)
    - Labeling mistakes influences whether the child will feel guilt/responsibility or frustration over getting caught (98)
    - Recruit others in a "labelling campaign" to reinforce a label (99). Story editing versus marketing and PR.
    - Fixed vs. growth mindset. Labels that imply innate talents ("fixed") can lead to devastation when there is failure. Labels that imply hard work, determination ("growth") lead to increased effort post-failure (p. 100-102).
- Volunteering: youth who choose a voluntary service effort are less likely to get pregnant (p. 127).
    - A large part of this, for teens, is that they are considered equals with exemplary adults.
- Excessive threats in exerting control over someone's behaviour can result in ironic processes, actually increasing the likelihood of the undesirable behaviour (p. 139-140).
    - this is in part due to inadvertent labelling (e.g., "I must be really bad if they're pulling out the big guns.") (p. 142)
- The effectiveness of one-on-one mentor/child relationships (p. 144)
- "Broken windows" theory of crime (p. 151). Applications to attire? Other forms of disorder?
- "Peer acceleration effect": bringing people together in groups for intervention or reform often backfires (p. 165)
- Targeting beliefs about peers (and, therefore, about groups and roles)
    - People tend to overestimate how often peers engage in risky behaviours (largely because of outlier salience) (p. 167-168)
    - Media plays an important role in influencing our perception of the frequency of risky behaviours (p. 168)
    - Descriptive vs. injunctive norms (p. 173)
- One overarching theme: people tend to fall into line with the roles that they are expected to play.
    - The task is to understand how people pick up on these expectations.
- Self-fulfilling prophecy in the minds of teachers
    - Rosenthal and Jacobsen study. Teachers were informed that, based on a (bogus) test, certain students were bright. These students had significantly higher IQ scores at the end of the year! (p. 208)
- Stereotype threat
    - Fear of being at risk of confirming a negative stereotype. This triggers anxiety and uses mental resources, typically leading to behaviour that confirms the stereotype (p. 221)
    - Stereotype lift (e.g., whites on an IQ test). (p. 222)
    - As with any narrative mechanism, stereotype threat is circular.
    - Simple reinterpretation of test or challenge eliminates stereotype threat. Positive role models (from the same group) can accomplish this (223)
    - One way of coping with something hard is to devalue it (the Fox and the Grapes, Aesop). p. 224
    - Image maintenance and protective self-redirection
        - Writing down strengths insulated minorities from stereotype threat
- Lasting change through interruption of negative or establishment of positive feedback cycles (edification!). p 230.
    - The genius of the LDS church structure (p. 231)
- The human mind doesn't process negations as well as it does affirmations (i.e., better to say, "I'm honest" rather than, "I'm not a crook.").
