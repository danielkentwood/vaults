Envision a two axis framework. On the horizontal axis, reverence (sophroneo, poise, self-possession, humility, smallness) versus ecstasy (passion, other-possession, abundance, largeness). On the vertical axis, separation (alone) versus communion (together with others).

The spectrum of human experience. Divinity and communion. Depravity and separation.

The experience of divinity. Of present salvation. Of being in the midst of all things. Of seeing the kingdom of God. Of knowing and walking with God (eternal life). This fleeting, ecstatic experience can be cultivated.

But is this experience the goal of our life? Or is it merely the consolation for doing what we should be doing in this life? Is it the comforter (only)?

Or does it motivate us to do the things we should do?

How do we cultivate it?

In my experience, only one way: an ascetic separation of oneself from anything that distracts from thoughts about god. This doesn’t mean separating oneself from society. One can be contemplating God in the form and content of a conversation or exchange. But god is always in the middle, mediating all experiences. It takes time to plant all the appropriate seeds in the place of the weeds that have grown, to cultivate these seeds and let them blossom into the behaviour of always filtering the world through God. All retrospection must be in the context of aligning future behaviour to god’s will. All immediate introspection must index god’s will.

It is a hard pill to swallow, but it is the price to pay for such glimpses of spiritual ecstasy. It is the price to pay for pulling aside the veil for a brief moment.

The etymology of the word ‘ecstasy’.

ekstasis. Ek = out. Stasis = standing still.

Displacement from a proper place. Often to refer to insanity.

Loss of control is an important component in the constellation of connotations here.

Rapture shares the same roots as rape.

Both have the connotation of being carried away against one’s will. Abduction.

Nympholepsy.

"An ecstasy or frenzy caused by a desire for the unattainable.”

This word should be used more often.

Continuum of sorrow and joy. At the extremes are loss of self and control.

The more we go in one direction, the more we are are able to appreciate and understand a move in the opposite direction. In other words, what we feel now is relative to where we have recently been.

Needs determine our satisfaction.
