## Documentation





To-do

- [ ]  re-think optimization approach. What other error metrics could I consider?
    - [ ]  Can I get multiple boluses?
- [ ]  consider doing a probabilistic approach with ranked suggestions (instead of just choosing the best one). This will become useful later if/when I get streaming data to work.
- [x]  build validation code into the package â€” the forecasts are pointless unless they are accurate.
- [ ]  you don't need to have real streaming data. You can create a massive dataset and host it somewhere, then have an API that pings it every five minutes for the next time point. This will work for now.
- [ ]  start writing unit tests and get CI/CD working on github or gitlab.

Focus on writing Medium articles. 

Content is important but less important than the ability to clearly communicate. 

Demonstrate that you understand the methodology and tooling and principles. This doesn't need to be a successful research project. 

A great skill to have is knowing when to stop on a project. 

- Once the model is predicting, use a brute force grid search (with parameters timing and amount of insulin) to identify the inputs where the model performs the best (according to some metric like the number of time points within the desired range).
- Future considerations:
    - maybe we only need to look at a scalar value where the peak of the insulin and carb impulse responses are happening?

Ultimate goal:

The app will ping the api for new data and will keep up to 6 months worth of data for a user.

[https://github.com/nightscout/cgm-remote-monitor/](https://github.com/nightscout/cgm-remote-monitor/)

The model will be updated once a week.

[SugarTS%206e9f2f53ef8b4bc4a2f0da68960735be/2008.02852.pdf](2008.02852.pdf)

Use something like DeepAR, which provides probabilistic forecasts.

[1704.04110.pdf](1704.04110.pdf)

Ultimately, the ideal would be to have a ranked list of "next best actions" to bring or keep glucose levels close to the target level. These would get updated every five minutes.

GOAL:

to understand the dose-response time series for

- protein
- simple and complex carbs
- 

IDEA:

Model all of the important covariates as gaussians with the following parameters:

- skew (long tail at start or finish of time-course?)
- bias (where does it peak in time)
- variance (how wide is the curve -- i.e., how long does the covariate have an effect on BG?)
- coefficient (determined by the amount of food, the dose of the
