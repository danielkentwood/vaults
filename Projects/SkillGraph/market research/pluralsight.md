## Pluralsight

* Pluralsight has two important concepts:
	* Skill IQ: A metric tied to a particular skill, fully determined by performance on an assessment. Best score out of two tries is kept. After making progress on learning more about a particular skill, users are given the opportunity to take the assessment again. This is an interesting way of validating, but it sounds sub-optimal to have it as the only means of validation. 
		* It would require massive resources for curating effective assessments for an arbitrary number of skills. 
		* It would place a very large burden on the user to retake an assessment every time they want to update their skill IQ. 
	* Role IQ
		* Aggregation of Skill IQ scores for a set of skills that are assigned to a role.
