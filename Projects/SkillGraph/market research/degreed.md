## Degreed
They come off as primarily marketing to business owners rather than individuals; they are pitching a platform for companies to upskill their employees. Their "Learning" product (landing page [here](https://explore.degreed.com/learning)) has some overlap with the higher.ai roadmap:
	* Integration of external platforms (learning, talent, HCM, work systems) for validation.
	* Tools for Skill Insights (although it looks like it's focused on skill coverage on a team, rather than an individual)
	* Profile pages that allow for rating of standardized skills (self rating, manager rating, and skill review assessment)
