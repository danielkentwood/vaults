## Ibbaka Talio
They have a platform for standardizing and tracking skill. Here is their [landing page](https://www.ibbaka.com/platforms-ibbaka-talio)
* **Positives:**
	* They are using a graph-based ontology of skill, and claim to be using AI for insights. 
	* They have documentation on the [core concepts](https://www.ibbaka.com/ibbaka-talent-blog/core-concepts-skill-graph) of their platform, starting with the skill graph. Some great ideas that are worth considering for higher.ai. 
	* There is a social networking component.
	* There is an API for integrations.
	* They have hiring (mapping applicant skill profiles to role profiles) on their roadmap
	* They have a helpful [knowledge center](https://www.ibbaka.com/knowledge-center), which is a great resource for UI research.
	* They have an interesting [blog](https://www.ibbaka.com/ibbaka-talent-blog/) with entries like [this one comparing their skill graph to a neural network](https://www.ibbaka.com/ibbaka-talent-blog/the-skill-graph-is-like-a-neural-network-it-captures-memories-and-guides-potential)
	
* **Criticisms:**
	* It is worth noting that the platform doesn't appear to be fully functional yet. Lots of broken links, especially when you try to access pricing or signing up. The team looks pretty small. They are most likely just getting started. They do have user profiles up and running (example [here](https://talent.ibbaka.com/gregory-ronczewski-517)), but it looks like it's mostly just their employees at the moment.
	* The visualization of the skills is pretty bad. 
	* No real gamification.
	* Validation is limited to testimonials
	* I signed up! That was surprisingly hard to find. Here are some quick observations:
		* The first thing you see when you sign up is a form asking you for your employment history. Instant buzzkill. 
		* They only have 3436 skills available
		* Most of them are skills that would be very difficult to validate in an unbiased, standardized fashion. For example, leadership, coaching, problem solving, design thinking, emotional vallue (misspelled, which suggests manual entry). I also noticed a few duplications (with the exact same spelling).
		* The skills are all listed in a massive table. You can filter by 8 different categories. 
		* Clicking on a skill expands a cell, allowing you to claim the skill. 
			* If you click "claim it!", you have to enter the name of the skill again before hitting submit. 
			* It shows you a list of related skills based on a bayesian model. I think the model may be struggling. For the SQL skill, the related skills are: skillsoft integration, SAML integration, Config I/O, remote server content, Saba certification best practices, IP filtering for application, and REST web services. At the very best, this list is doing a decent job for a very small, biased sample that is heavily biased toward a specific type of back end web development. At the worst, it's not a good model. 
		* The personal profile page is butt ugly.
