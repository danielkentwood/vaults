## Cornerstone
A new company (first newsroom entry is about choosing a CEO in January 2022) that is targeting the HR tech space. Looks like they are still in development mode (they only offer demos currently). They have a very broad offering, and the skill ontology stuff that I'm interested in is buried pretty deep.

	* [skills graph](https://www.cornerstoneondemand.com/solutions/skills-graph/)
	* [modern learning experience](https://www.cornerstoneondemand.com/solutions/modern-learning-experience/)
		* Career path tool: They are tracking common career paths, exposing them as sankey diagrams.
		* Web-sourced content: They have a "content engine" that automatically detects topics, skills, and the tone of the content for higher-quality curation.
