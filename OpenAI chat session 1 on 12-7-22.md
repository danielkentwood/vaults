> [!question]
> How can I compute a co-occurence matrix?

A co-occurrence matrix is a matrix that shows how often certain events or items occur together in a dataset. To compute a co-occurrence matrix, you need to first determine the events or items that you want to track, and then count how often they occur together in the dataset.

Here is one way to compute a co-occurrence matrix:

1.  Begin by creating a matrix with the same number of rows and columns as the number of events or items you want to track. For example, if you want to track the co-occurrence of words in a text document, the matrix should have the same number of rows and columns as the number of unique words in the document.
    
2.  Next, go through the dataset and count how often each pair of events or items occurs together. For example, if you are tracking the co-occurrence of words in a text document, you would go through the document and count how often each pair of words appears in the same sentence or phrase.
    
3.  As you count the co-occurrences, add the counts to the appropriate cells in the matrix. For example, if you are tracking the co-occurrence of words in a text document and you find that the word "cat" and the word "dog" appear together three times, you would add 3 to the cell in the matrix that corresponds to the "cat" row and the "dog" column.
    
4.  When you have finished counting the co-occurrences, the matrix will show how often each pair of events or items occurred together in the dataset.
    

Note that this is just one way to compute a co-occurrence matrix. There may be other methods that are more efficient or more suitable for your particular use case.

> [!question]
> Can you implement these instructions in a Python script using PySpark?

Sure, here is a Python script that uses PySpark to compute a co-occurrence matrix:

```python
# Import the necessary modules
from pyspark import SparkContext, SQLContext

# Create a SparkContext and a SQLContext
sc = SparkContext()
sqlContext = SQLContext(sc)

# Load the dataset and create a DataFrame
df = sqlContext.read.csv("dataset.csv")

# Create a list of the events or items you want to track
events = ["event1", "event2", "event3", ...]

# Create a co-occurrence matrix with the same number of rows and columns as the number of events
co_matrix = [[0 for i in range(len(events))] for j in range(len(events))]

# Go through the DataFrame and count the co-occurrences
for index, row in df.iterrows():
    for i in range(len(events)):
        for j in range(len(events)):
            if row[events[i]] == 1 and row[events[j]] == 1:
                co_matrix[i][j] += 1

# Print the co-occurrence matrix
for row in co_matrix:
    print(row)

```

This script assumes that your dataset is stored in a CSV file and that each row in the dataset contains a binary value (1 or 0) for each event or item that you want to track. The script will go through the dataset and count how often each pair of events or items occurs together, and then it will print the co-occurrence matrix to the console.

You may need to modify this script to fit your specific use case. For example, you may want to use a different method to load the dataset, or you may want to use different data types or structures for the co-occurrence matrix.

> [!question]
> Great, now suppose I have a SQL table of medical claims. It is called edw_enc.med_claims. Each row is a unique claim. There are 2 billion rows. The columns are: 
> 	1. member_id: the identification number of the member who received the medical service 
> 	2. claim_id: a unique identifier for each claim 
> 	3. icd_cd: the ICD code on the claim 
> 	4. service_dt: the date of the medical service on the claim

> This table represents the medical journeys of millions of members (where "members" are people who are enrolled with a specific health insurance payer). I want to track how often each ICD code occurs in the 6 months preceding every other ICD code, with the stipulation that ICD codes can only co-occur within the same member's journey. Can you modify the code above so that it does this?

Sure, here is a modified version of the Python script that uses PySpark to compute a co-occurrence matrix for the medical claims data:

```python
# Import the necessary modules
from pyspark import SparkContext, SQLContext

# Create a SparkContext and a SQLContext
sc = SparkContext()
sqlContext = SQLContext(sc)

# Load the medical claims data and create a DataFrame
df = sqlContext.read.table("edw_enc.med_claims")

# Create a list of the ICD codes that you want to track
icd_codes = ["ICD1", "ICD2", "ICD3", ...]

# Create a co-occurrence matrix with the same number of rows and columns as the number of ICD codes
co_matrix = [[0 for i in range(len(icd_codes))] for j in range(len(icd_codes))]

# Go through the DataFrame and count the co-occurrences
for index, row in df.iterrows():
    for i in range(len(icd_codes)):
        for j in range(len(icd_codes)):
            # Check if the ICD codes occurred within 6 months of each other and within the same member's journey
            if row["icd_cd"] == icd_codes[i] and row["icd_cd"] == icd_codes[j] and abs(row["service_dt"] - row["service_dt"]) <= 183 and row["member_id"] == row["member_id"]:
                co_matrix[i][j] += 1

# Print the co-occurrence matrix
for row in co_matrix:
    print(row)

```

This script will go through the medical claims data and count how often each pair of ICD codes occurs together within 6 months of each other and within the same member's journey. It will then print the co-occurrence matrix to the console.

You may need to modify this script to fit your specific use case. For example, you may need to adjust the criteria for determining when two ICD codes co-occur, or you may want to use a different data type or structure for the co-occurrence matrix.

> [!question]
> Great. Now, instead of initializing a full matrix of zeros for the co_matrix variable, can we populate a sparse matrix?

Yes, you can use a sparse matrix to store the co-occurrence data if you want to save memory and space. A sparse matrix is a matrix that only stores the non-zero values in the matrix, rather than storing all of the values. This can be useful when the matrix is very large and has a lot of zero values, as is the case with a co-occurrence matrix.

Here is a modified version of the Python script that uses PySpark to compute a co-occurrence matrix using a sparse matrix:

```python
# Import the necessary modules
from pyspark import SparkContext, SQLContext
from scipy.sparse import coo_matrix

# Create a SparkContext and a SQLContext
sc = SparkContext()
sqlContext = SQLContext(sc)

# Load the medical claims data and create a DataFrame
df = sqlContext.read.table("edw_enc.med_claims")

# Create a list of the ICD codes that you want to track
icd_codes = ["ICD1", "ICD2", "ICD3", ...]

# Create lists to store the row indices, column indices, and values of the non-zero entries in the co-occurrence matrix
row_indices = []
col_indices = []
values = []

# Go through the DataFrame and count the co-occurrences
for index, row in df.iterrows():
    for i in range(len(icd_codes)):
        for j in range(len(icd_codes)):
            # Check if the ICD codes occurred within 6 months of each other and within the same member's journey
            if row["icd_cd"] == icd_codes[i] and row["icd_cd"] == icd_codes[j] and abs(row["service_dt"] - row["service_dt"]) <= 183 and row["member_id"] == row["member_id"]:
                # Add the row index, column index, and value to the appropriate lists
                row_indices.append(i)
                col_indices.append(j)
                values.append(1)

# Create a co-occurrence matrix using the lists of row indices, column indices, and values
co_matrix = coo_matrix((values, (row_indices, col_indices)), shape=(len(icd_codes), len(icd_codes)))

# Print the co-occurrence matrix
print(co_matrix)

```

This script will go through the medical claims data and count how often each pair of ICD codes occurs together within 6 months of each other and within the same member's journey. It will then create a sparse matrix using the scipy.sparse.coo_matrix function, and it will print the co-occurrence matrix to the console.

You may need to modify this script to fit your specific use case. For example, you may need to adjust the criteria for determining when two ICD codes co-occur, or you may want to use a different data type or structure for the co-occurrence matrix.

> [!question]
> Do you think the code above will be able to handle 2 billion rows?

It is possible that the code above will be able to handle 2 billion rows, but it may not be very efficient. The code uses a nested loop to go through each pair of ICD codes and count the co-occurrences, which can be slow and memory-intensive for very large datasets.

If you need to compute a co-occurrence matrix for a dataset with 2 billion rows, you may want to consider using a different method or algorithm that is more efficient and scalable. For example, you could use a distributed computing framework like Apache Spark to distribute the computation across multiple machines and speed up the process. You could also use a different data structure, such as a sparse matrix, to store the co-occurrence data and save memory and space.

It is also worth noting that the co-occurrence matrix for a dataset with 2 billion rows will be very large, potentially containing billions of entries. You may need to use a specialized data analysis tool or library that is designed to handle large datasets and matrices in order to analyze and make sense of the co-occurrence data.

> [!question]

Here is a more efficient version of the Python script that uses PySpark to compute a co-occurrence matrix for the medical claims data:

```python
# Import the necessary modules
from pyspark import SparkContext, SQLContext
from scipy.sparse import coo_matrix

# Create a SparkContext and a SQLContext

sqlContext = SQLContext(sc)

# Load the medical claims data and create a DataFrame

# Use the DataFrame to create a pair RDD where each key is a member ID and each value is a tuple containing an ICD code and a service date
pair_rdd = df.map(lambda row: (row["member_id"], (row["icd_cd"], row["service_dt"])))

# Use the pair RDD to create a new RDD where each key is a member ID and each value is a list of tuples containing ICD codes and service dates
list_rdd = pair_rdd.groupByKey().map(lambda x: (x[0], list(x[1])))

# Use the list RDD to create a new RDD where each key is a pair of ICD codes and each value is the number of co-occurrences within 6 months of each other and within the same member's journey
co_rdd = list_rdd.flatMap(lambda x: [(tuple(sorted((i[0], j[0]))), 1) for i in x[1] for j in x[1] if i[0] != j[0] and abs(i[1] - j[1]) <= 183])

# Use the co-occurrence RDD to create a dictionary where the keys are pairs of ICD codes and the values are the number of co-occurrences
co_dict = co_rdd.reduceByKey(lambda x, y: x + y).collectAsMap()

# Create lists to store the row indices, column indices, and values of the non-zero entries in the co-occurrence matrix
row_indices = []
col_indices = []
values = []

# Go through the dictionary and populate the lists of row indices, column indices, and values
for key, value in co_dict.items():
    i, j = key
    row_indices.append(icd_codes.index(i))
    col_indices.append(icd_codes.index(j))
    values.append(value)

# Create a co-occurrence matrix using the lists of row indices, column indices, and values
co_matrix = coo_matrix((values, (row_indices, col_indices)), shape=(len(icd_codes), len(icd_codes)))

# Print the co-occurrence matrix
print(co_matrix)

```

This script uses the power of PySpark to distribute the computation across multiple machines and speed up the process of computing the co-occurrence matrix. It also uses a sparse matrix to store the co-occurrence data and save memory and space.

This script should be more efficient and scalable.

> [!question]
> What if, instead of computing co-occurrence values, I wanted to compute the probability of co-occurrence across members?

To compute the probability of co-occurrence across members, you can use a slightly modified version of the Python script from the previous answer. The main difference is that instead of counting the number of co-occurrences, you will need to calculate the probability of co-occurrence for each pair of ICD codes.

Here is a modified version of the Python script that uses PySpark to compute the probability of co-occurrence for each pair of ICD codes:

```python
# Import the necessary modules
from pyspark import SparkContext, SQLContext
from scipy.sparse import coo_matrix

# Create a SparkContext and a SQLContext
sc = SparkContext()
sqlContext = SQLContext(sc)

# Load the medical claims data and create a DataFrame
df = sqlContext.read.table("edw_enc.med_claims")

# Create a list of the ICD codes that you want to track
icd_codes = ["ICD1", "ICD2", "ICD3", ...]

# Use the DataFrame to create a pair RDD where each key is a member ID and each value is a tuple containing an ICD code and a service date
pair_rdd = df.map(lambda row: (row["member_id"], (row["icd_cd"], row["service_dt"])))

# Use the pair RDD to create a new RDD where each key is a member ID and each value is a list of tuples containing ICD codes and service dates
list_rdd = pair_rdd.groupByKey().map(lambda x: (x[0], list(x[1])))

# Use the list RDD to create a new RDD where each key is a pair of ICD codes and each value is the number of co-occurrences within 6 months of each other and within the same member's journey
co_rdd = list_rdd.flatMap(lambda x: [(tuple(sorted((i[0], j[0]))), 1) for i in x[1] for j in x[1] if i[0] != j[0] and abs(i[1] - j[1]) <= 183])

# Use the co-occurrence RDD to create a dictionary where the keys are pairs of ICD codes and the values are the number of co-occurrences
co_dict = co_rdd.reduceByKey(lambda x, y: x + y).collectAsMap()

# Count the number of members in the dataset
num_members = df.select("member_id").distinct().count()

# Create lists to store the row indices, column indices, and values of the non-zero entries in the co-occurrence matrix
row_indices = []
col_indices = []
values = []

# Go through the dictionary and calculate the probability of co-occurrence for each pair of ICD codes
for key, value in co_dict.items():
    i, j = key
    row_indices.append(icd_codes.index(i))
    col_indices.append(icd_codes.index(j))
    values.append(value / num_members)

# Create a co-occurrence matrix using the lists of row indices, column indices, and values
co_matrix = coo_matrix((values, (row_indices, col_indices)), shape=(len(icd_codes), len(icd_codes)))

# Print the co-occurrence matrix
print(co_matrix)

```

This code is using the Apache Spark framework to analyze medical claims data and create a co-occurrence matrix. The co-occurrence matrix is a square matrix that shows the probability of co-occurrence for each pair of International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes within a given dataset.

The code first imports the necessary modules from the PySpark and SciPy libraries. It then creates a SparkContext and a SQLContext, which are used to create a DataFrame from the medical claims data. The code then creates a list of ICD codes that it wants to track, and uses the DataFrame to create a pair RDD (Resilient Distributed Dataset) where each key is a member ID and each value is a tuple containing an ICD code and a service date.

The code then uses this pair RDD to create a new RDD where each key is a member ID and each value is a list of tuples containing ICD codes and service dates. It then uses this list RDD to create another RDD where each key is a pair of ICD codes and each value is the number of co-occurrences within 6 months of each other and within the same member's journey.

The code then uses this co-occurrence RDD to create a dictionary where the keys are pairs of ICD codes and the values are the number of co-occurrences. It then counts the number of members in the dataset and uses this value to calculate the probability of co-occurrence for each pair of ICD codes.

Finally, the code creates a co-occurrence matrix using the calculated probabilities, and the lists of row indices, column indices, and values of the non-zero entries in the matrix. This matrix can be used for further analysis, such as identifying clusters of co-occurring ICD codes within the medical claims data.

> [!question]
> I want you to change this code. In the section where it loops through ICD code pairs in co_dict and appends to the values list, value is currently divided by num_members, which is the total number of members in the table. Instead of dividing by the total number of members, I want, for each pair of ICD codes in co_dict, to divide by the number of members who had that pair of ICD codes at least once. 

```python
# Import the necessary modules
from pyspark import SparkContext, SQLContext
from scipy.sparse import coo_matrix

# Create a SparkContext and a SQLContext
sc = SparkContext()
sqlContext = SQLContext(sc)

# Load the medical claims data and create a DataFrame
df = sqlContext.read.table("edw_enc.med_claims")

# Create a list of the ICD codes that you want to track
icd_codes = ["ICD1", "ICD2", "ICD3", ...]

# Use the DataFrame to create a pair RDD where each key is a member ID and each value is a tuple containing an ICD code and a service date
pair_rdd = df.map(lambda row: (row["member_id"], (row["icd_cd"], row["service_dt"])))

# Use the pair RDD to create a new RDD where each key is a member ID and each value is a list of tuples containing ICD codes and service dates
list_rdd = pair_rdd.groupByKey().map(lambda x: (x[0], list(x[1])))

# Use the list RDD to create a new RDD where each key is a pair of ICD codes and each value is the number of co-occurrences within 6 months of each other and within the same member's journey
co_rdd = list_rdd.flatMap(lambda x: [(tuple(sorted((i[0], j[0]))), 1) for i in x[1] for j in x[1] if i[0] != j[0] and abs(i[1] - j[1]) <= 183])

# Use the co-occurrence RDD to create a dictionary where the keys are pairs of ICD codes and the values are the number of co-occurrences
co_dict = co_rdd.reduceByKey(lambda x, y: x + y).collectAsMap()

# Create lists to store the row indices, column indices, and values of the non-zero entries in the co-occurrence matrix
row_indices = []
col_indices = []
values = []

# Go through the dictionary and calculate the probability of co-occurrence for each pair of ICD codes
for key, value in co_dict.items():
    i, j = key
    # Count the number of members who had this pair of ICD codes at least once
    num_members = list_rdd.filter(lambda x: set(key).issubset([i[0] for i in x[1]])).count()
    row_indices.append(icd_codes.index(i))
    col_indices.append(icd_codes.index(j))
    values.append(value / num_members)

# Create a co-occurrence matrix using the lists of row indices, column indices, and values
co_matrix = coo_matrix((values, (row_indices, col_indices)), shape=(len(icd_codes), len(icd_codes)))

```

> Next step is to normalize co_matrix by row. This will give the probability of co-occurence of a given pair $(A_1, B_1)$ relative to the probability of every other pair $(A_1, B_k)$. The resulting value indicates the degree to which ICD code A _uniquely predicts_ ICD code B. 

```python
from scipy.sparse import coo_matrix
import numpy as np

def normalize_coo_matrix_by_row(matrix: coo_matrix) -> coo_matrix:
  # Get the row and column indices of the non-zero elements in the matrix
  row_indices, col_indices = matrix.row, matrix.col

  # Calculate the length of each row vector
  row_lengths = np.sqrt(np.square(matrix.data).sum(axis=1))

  # Divide each element in the matrix by the length of the corresponding row vector
  normalized_data = matrix.data / row_lengths[row_indices]

  # Return a new coo_matrix with the normalized data
  return coo_matrix((normalized_data, (row_indices, col_indices)), shape=matrix.shape)

```
