List of really good courses:
[https://medium.com/datatau/the-online-courses-you-must-take-to-be-a-better-data-scientist-36a06016c819](https://medium.com/datatau/the-online-courses-you-must-take-to-be-a-better-data-scientist-36a06016c819)

**Practice goals:**
- Reach the point where you can implement a basic version of important models within 20 minutes with a clean dataset:
    - Implement these in sklearn, keras/tf, and pytorch. If you can, also implement these from scratch in numpy

---

**Meet one goal each day, and record in a journal:**
- Complete a HackerRank, DailyCodingProblem, or Leetcode problem
- Complete a SQL problem
- Train and test a model on a practice data set

---

**STUDY SCHEDULE**

**AM, Monday-Friday:** Wake up at 6:30, make some tea, go straight to computer, work on online instruction until 7:30
**PM, Monday-Friday:** Spend 1 hour on portfolio project

**If you have more time:**
- 1 challenge on HackerRank or Leetcode (30 min)
- Read machine learning article/book for at least 30 min
    - think about printing out chapters so you can take notes?
- Listen to machine learning podcasts during commute

---

**Develop short code examples and write-ups for working with the following:**

Databases (i.e., can you store and retrieve data efficiently?)
Machine Learning (i.e., do you understand the algorithms and mainstream APIs?)
Software Engineering (i.e., can you write production-quality code?)
- Style/patterns:
- Unit Testing
- Docker:
- Django:
- Git:

Algorithms and Data Structures (i.e., can you think through difficult computational problems?)
