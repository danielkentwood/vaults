> I was born and raised in a Mormon (Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints) family. It is notoriously difficult to leave a religion like the Mormon religion. There are many reasons for this. Here are three examples: (1) it demands massive amounts of sacrifice of wealth and time in order to remain in good standing; this creates a pattern of commitment that can be psychologically difficult to break, (2) it encourages an "us" versus "them" attitude toward people outside of the faith; this encourages members to socialize preferentially with other members, and (3) the Mormon church teaches that ordinances like baptism and marriage constitute covenants with God, and these covenants create a chain that binds us to God and to our family members who have also made these covenants. For Mormons, the only way to be with your family in the afterlife is to stay faithful to those covenants. If someone leaves the Mormon church, they are viewed as having broken their covenants, and therefore cannot be with their family in the afterlife. This dynamic creates massive pressure to not leave the church in order to avoid damaging relationships with family members.

> Another way of framing this is to say that we will model each human self as a separate graph of needs, skills, motivations, beliefs, habits, values, etc., and that each of these graphs can be modeled as a node in a larger graph that represents the relationships between different humans. In this top layer graph of human relationships, the strength of the connection between nodes represents the degree to which severing that connection would perturb the inner graph of the individual. Can you flesh out this metaphor for me?

Sure, let me see if I can provide some additional explanation and examples to help develop this metaphor further.

One way to think about the difficulty of leaving the Mormon religion is to consider the individual as a node in a larger graph of relationships and connections. In this model, the node represents the individual themselves, and the connections between nodes represent the various relationships and ties that an individual has with others in their community. These connections could include family relationships, friendships, professional connections, and religious affiliations.

At the same time, each individual node can be thought of as containing a smaller, nested graph that represents the individual's own internal beliefs, values, and motivations. This inner graph is shaped by the individual's experiences and circumstances, and it can influence the decisions and actions that the individual takes.

When an individual is considering leaving the Mormon religion, the forces acting on their node can be thought of as the various connections and relationships that they have with others in their community. In the case of the Mormon religion, these connections can be particularly strong due to the emphasis on the importance of family relationships and the significance of religious covenants.

For example, the connection between an individual and their family members who are also members of the Mormon faith could be particularly strong, as breaking this connection could be seen as damaging to the individual's relationships with their family. Similarly, the connection between an individual and the Mormon community as a whole could be strong due to the sense of belonging and support that the community provides.

In this way, the forces acting on an individual who is considering leaving the Mormon religion can be thought of as the various connections and relationships that they have within the community. The strength of these connections can make it difficult for the individual to break away from the community and explore alternative beliefs and practices.

> [!Question]
> Can you incorporate what we understand about network dynamics to add to this metaphor?

Sure, we can incorporate some of the principles of network dynamics to further develop this metaphor. In a network of connections between nodes, the forces acting on any given node are determined by the strength and number of connections that the node has with other nodes.

In the context of the Mormon religion, the strength of the connections between individual nodes (i.e., individuals) can be thought of as representing the degree to which severing those connections would perturb the inner graph of the individual. In other words, the stronger the connections between nodes, the more difficult it would be for an individual to break away from those connections and explore alternative beliefs and practices.

Additionally, the number of connections that a node has with other nodes can also affect the forces acting on that node. For example, an individual who has many connections within the Mormon community (e.g., through their family, friends, and professional connections) may experience stronger forces acting on them to remain within the community, as breaking those connections could have a significant impact on their personal and social networks.

Overall, by incorporating principles of network dynamics, we can further develop the metaphor of the individual as a node in a larger graph of connections to better understand the forces acting on an individual who is considering leaving the Mormon religion. These forces can be thought of as the strength and number of connections that the individual has within the community, and the impact that breaking those connections would have on the individual's inner beliefs, values, and motivations.

Imagine that the connections between the nodes in the top layer graph are not static, but rather they evolve and change over time based on the interactions and behaviors of the individuals. For example, a person who regularly attends church and participates in community activities is more likely to have stronger connections with other members, while a person who is less active and socializes less with other members is more likely to have weaker connections.

These evolving connections can be seen as a network dynamic, where the behavior of the individuals influences the strength of the connections between them. In the case of the Mormon religion, the demands for sacrifice and commitment, the emphasis on group identity and socialization, and the doctrine of eternal covenants create a network dynamic that reinforces the connections between the nodes, making it difficult for an individual to break away from the group.

For example, a person who is considering leaving the Mormon church might find that the strong connections with other members make it difficult for them to socialize outside of the church, or that their family members who are still active in the church put pressure on them to remain faithful. This can create a feedback loop where the individual feels isolated and alone, and the pressure to conform and maintain their connections with the group becomes even stronger.

In this way, the network dynamic of the top layer graph can be seen as a force that acts on the individual, influencing their behavior and making it difficult for them to break away from the group and explore new paths in their internal landscape.

> [!Question]
> I want to further explore the relationship between the inner graph of the individual and the outer graph of social relationships. Can you provide some concrete examples of how the connections of the inner graph are influenced by the connections in the outer graph, or vice versa?

Certainly. Here are a few examples of how the connections within an individual's inner graph of beliefs, values, and motivations can be influenced by the connections in their outer graph of social relationships:

1.  An individual who has strong familial connections within the Mormon community may be more likely to adopt the beliefs and practices of the Mormon faith, as they are exposed to those beliefs and practices through their family members.
    
2.  An individual who has close friendships with other members of the Mormon community may be more likely to participate in Mormon religious activities and events, as they are encouraged to do so by their friends.
    
3.  An individual who is active in the Mormon community (e.g., through service or leadership roles) may develop a strong sense of commitment and identity within the community, which can shape their inner beliefs and values.
    

Conversely, the connections within an individual's inner graph can also influence the connections in their outer graph of social relationships. For example:

1.  An individual who holds strong religious beliefs may be more likely to seek out and establish connections with others who share those beliefs, leading to the formation of social networks within the Mormon community.
    
2.  An individual who has a deep commitment to the Mormon faith may be more likely to maintain strong connections with their family members who are also members of the Mormon community, even if those connections are strained or challenged in some way.
    
3.  An individual who has strong personal convictions about their religious beliefs may be less likely to be influenced by the beliefs and practices of others in their social network, even if those beliefs and practices differ from their own.
    

Overall, there is a dynamic relationship between the connections within an individual's inner and outer graphs, with each influencing and shaping the other in various ways.

**Here is another iteration of this answer...**

Sure, here are some possible examples of how the connections in the inner graph of the individual can be influenced by the connections in the outer graph of social relationships:

-   A person who has strong connections with their family members who are active in the Mormon church is more likely to have internal beliefs and values that align with the teachings of the church. For example, they might have a strong belief in the importance of maintaining their covenants with God, and this belief might be reinforced by their regular interactions with their family members who share this belief. In this way, the connections in the outer graph can influence the connections in the inner graph.
-   A person who is considering leaving the Mormon church might find that the strong connections with other members make it difficult for them to socialize outside of the church, or that their family members who are still active in the church put pressure on them to remain faithful. This can create a feedback loop where the individual feels isolated and alone, and the pressure to conform and maintain their connections with the group becomes even stronger. In this way, the connections in the outer graph can influence the connections in the inner graph by creating a sense of pressure and isolation that makes it difficult for the individual to break away from the group and explore new paths.

Here are some possible examples of how the connections in the inner graph of the individual can influence the connections in the outer graph of social relationships:

-   A person who has internal beliefs and values that align with the teachings of the Mormon church is more likely to participate in church activities and socialize with other members. This can create stronger connections with other members, as well as a sense of belonging and community. In this way, the connections in the inner graph can influence the connections in the outer graph by driving the individual's behavior and interactions with others.
-   A person who has internal beliefs and values that conflict with the teachings of the Mormon church is more likely to have weaker connections with other members, as well as a sense of isolation and disconnection. For example, they might feel uncomfortable attending church activities or socializing with other members, and this can create a feedback loop where the weaker connections in the outer graph reinforce the internal beliefs and values that conflict with the church. In this way, the connections in the inner graph can influence the connections in the outer graph by driving the individual's behavior and interactions with others.


> [!Question]
> How can we express this metaphor in language that is easy to understand for a broad audience?

One way to express this metaphor in language that is easy to understand for a broad audience would be to use the metaphor of a tree. In this metaphor, the individual is represented by the trunk of the tree, with their inner beliefs, values, and motivations represented by the roots of the tree. The connections with other individuals in their social network are represented by the branches of the tree, and the strength of those connections is represented by the size and number of branches.

This metaphor allows us to easily explain how the connections within an individual's inner and outer graphs influence each other. For example, we could say that the roots of the tree represent an individual's inner beliefs and values, and that these roots are nourished and strengthened by the connections with other individuals represented by the branches of the tree. Conversely, the branches of the tree are also influenced by the roots, as the strength and stability of the branches are determined by the health and vitality of the roots.

Overall, this metaphor provides a simple and intuitive way to explain the relationship between an individual's inner and outer graphs, and how those connections can influence and shape each other.

> [!Question]
> But this metaphor of a tree makes it hard to talk about leaving mormonism. Is there a different metaphor we could use that would make it easier to talk about restructuring the graph by leaving the religion?

Another metaphor that could be used to talk about restructuring the graph by leaving the Mormon religion is the metaphor of a web or net. In this metaphor, the individual is represented by a central node in the web, with their inner beliefs, values, and motivations represented by the strands that connect the node to other nodes in the web. The connections with other individuals in their social network are represented by the other nodes in the web, and the strength of those connections is represented by the number and thickness of the strands connecting the nodes.

This metaphor allows us to easily explain how an individual can restructure their connections by leaving the Mormon religion. For example, we could say that an individual who is considering leaving the Mormon religion is represented by a central node in the web, with strong connections to other nodes in the web that represent their family, friends, and community within the Mormon religion. If the individual decides to leave the Mormon religion, they can do so by breaking or cutting the strands that represent those connections, allowing them to explore alternative beliefs and practices.

Overall, this metaphor provides a simple and intuitive way to explain how an individual can restructure their connections within a social network by leaving a religion like the Mormon faith. It also allows us to easily talk about the challenges and difficulties that can be involved in making such a decision, as breaking the connections represented by the strands in the web can have significant consequences for an individual's personal and social relationships.

> [!Question]
> Is it possible to incorporate the notion of entropy into our discussion of why it is difficult to restructure a network?]

Yes, the concept of entropy can be incorporated into our discussion of why it is difficult to restructure a network. In the context of a social network like the Mormon community, entropy can be thought of as a measure of the degree of disorder or randomness in the network.

When an individual is considering leaving the Mormon religion, the forces acting on their node (i.e., themselves) can be thought of as the various connections and relationships that they have within the community. In general, these forces will tend to resist any changes to the network that would increase its entropy, or level of disorder. This is because changes that increase entropy are typically associated with a loss of stability and predictability in the network, which can be unsettling and disorienting for the individuals involved.

Therefore, when an individual is considering leaving the Mormon religion, they may experience resistance from the forces acting on their node due to the potential increase in entropy that would result from restructuring the network. This can make it difficult for the individual to break away from the community and explore alternative beliefs and practices.

Overall, the concept of entropy can provide a useful framework for understanding the challenges and difficulties involved in restructuring a social network like the Mormon community. By considering the potential impact of changes on the network's entropy, we can better understand the forces acting on an individual who is considering leaving the religion, and the challenges they may face in making such a decision.

**Another iteration of the answer...**

Yes, the concept of entropy can be incorporated into our discussion of network dynamics and the difficulty of restructuring a network.

In thermodynamics, entropy is a measure of the disorder or randomness in a system. In general, a system will tend to move from a state of lower entropy to a state of higher entropy, meaning that it will tend to become more disordered and random over time. This is because there are more possible ways for a system to be disordered than to be ordered, so it is more likely for a system to end up in a disordered state.

In the context of network dynamics, entropy can be seen as a measure of the disorder or randomness in the connections between the nodes. For example, a network with strong, well-defined connections between the nodes is said to have low entropy, while a network with weak, diffuse connections between the nodes is said to have high entropy.

In general, a network will tend to move from a state of low entropy to a state of high entropy over time, because there are more possible ways for a network to be disordered than to be ordered. This means that it is more likely for a network to become more random and disordered over time, unless there are external forces that act to maintain the order and structure of the network.

In the case of the Mormon religion, the strong demands for sacrifice and commitment, the emphasis on group identity and socialization, and the doctrine of eternal covenants create external forces that act to maintain the order and structure of the network. These forces can be seen as counteracting the natural tendency of the network to move toward a state of higher entropy, and they make it difficult for an individual to break away from the group and explore new paths in their internal landscape.

In this way, the concept of entropy can be incorporated into our discussion of network dynamics and the difficulty of restructuring a network by providing a measure of the disorder or randomness in the connections between the nodes, and by highlighting the role of external forces in maintaining the order and structure of the network.

> [!Question]
> Is it possible to come up with a mathematical formula to express how the restructuring of a network can only happen when the entropy of that restructuring is minimized to some threshold?

It is possible to come up with a mathematical formula to express how the restructuring of a network can only happen when the entropy of that restructuring is minimized to some threshold. This formula would take into account the various forces acting on an individual who is considering leaving a religion like the Mormon faith, and would determine the conditions under which it would be possible for that individual to successfully restructure their connections within the network.

One possible way to express this formula is as follows:

Let S be the current state of the network, representing the current connections and relationships within the community.

Let E be the entropy of the network, representing the degree of disorder or randomness in the network.

Let F be the forces acting on the individual who is considering leaving the religion, representing the various connections and relationships that the individual has within the community.

Let T be the threshold level of entropy that the individual is willing to tolerate in order to successfully restructure their connections within the network.

The formula for determining the feasibility of restructuring the network can then be expressed as follows:

If (E - T) > 0, then the individual is able to successfully restructure their connections within the network.

In other words, if the entropy of the network (E) is greater than the individual's threshold level of entropy (T), then the individual will be able to successfully restructure their connections within the network. This is because the forces acting on the individual (F) will not be strong enough to prevent the restructuring of the network, given the level of disorder and randomness that is already present in the network.

However, if (E - T) < 0, then the individual will not be able to successfully restructure their connections within the network. This is because the forces acting on the individual (F) will be too strong to overcome, given the low level of entropy in the network.

Overall, this mathematical formula provides a way to express the relationship between the entropy of a network and the feasibility of restructuring that network, in the context of an individual who is considering leaving a religion like the Mormon faith.

Let E be the entropy of the network, representing the degree of disorder or randomness in the network. Let F be the forces acting on the individual who is considering leaving the religion, representing the various connections and relationships that the individual has within the community. Let T be the threshold level of entropy that the individual is willing to tolerate in order to successfully restructure their connections within the network. Can you create a system of equations that expresses the relationships between the state of the individual inner network, the state of the forces acting on them, the state of the social network, and the probability that the individual will leave their religion?

Sure, here is a possible system of equations that expresses the relationships between the state of the individual's inner network, the state of the forces acting on them, the state of the social network, and the probability that the individual will leave their religion:

1.  S = f(F)

-   This equation expresses the relationship between the state of the social network (S) and the forces acting on the individual (F). The function f() represents the various ways in which the forces acting on the individual can influence the state of the social network, such as by strengthening or weakening the connections between the nodes.

2.  E = g(S)

-   This equation expresses the relationship between the entropy of the network (E) and the state of the social network (S). The function g() represents the various ways in which the state of the social network can influence the entropy of the network, such as by increasing or decreasing the disorder or randomness in the connections between the nodes.

3.  P = h(E, T)

-   This equation expresses the relationship between the probability that the individual will leave their religion (P) and the entropy of the network (E) and the individual's threshold level of entropy (T). The function h() represents the various ways in which the entropy of the network and the individual's threshold level can influence the probability that the individual will leave their religion, such as by increasing or decreasing the likelihood that the individual will be willing to tolerate the disorder or randomness in the network in order to successfully restructure their connections within the network.

For example, if the state of the social network is such that the forces acting on the individual are very strong (F is high), then the state of the social network is likely to be well-ordered and structured (S is low), which in turn will result in a low level of entropy (E is low). In this case, the probability that the individual will leave their religion is likely to be low, because the individual is likely to be resistant to the forces acting on them and unwilling to tolerate a high level of entropy in order to successfully restructure their connections within the network.

On the other hand, if the state of the social network is such that the forces acting on the individual are weak (F is low), then the state of the social network is likely to be disordered and random (S is high), which in turn will result in a high level of entropy (E is high). In this case, the probability that the individual will leave their religion is likely to be high, because the individual is likely to be more susceptible to the forces acting on them and more willing to tolerate a high level of entropy in order to successfully restructure their connections within the network.
