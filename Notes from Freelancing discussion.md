#### Presentation by [[Ó Joe Papa]] and [[Ó Matt Kirk]]

- Freelancing is a great way to get experience, make some money, and learn new techniques.
- To become a better leader, volunteer.
- Do things cheaper than the next person — it will get you experience.

MailChimp - send out lots of emails. Start a list. Start writing content. Start creating something that people want and need. 

Personal network is the first place you start. 

In your communications, lead with value. 

Come up with example projects that you could do for people — then do those projects as proof that you can do it. 

Goal isn't to get hired in the first encounter with somebody. 

Use your knowledge and experience in marketing gained from Exponent. You know how to market. Do talks. Write papers. Get your name out there. Carve out your niche. 

Be over-focused on bringing value to other people. People from academia tend to train themselves to bring value to themselves. This is good for training, but it is important to learn to think for the shareholder/client. 

Talk to other consultants. Learn from them. 

Seek out people that are doing what you want to be doing. Talk to them. Interview them.

Seed your profile. 

Nothing preventing you from creating an upwork profile. Get people in your network to hire you on upwork instead of just hiring you externally. This sacrifices some money in return for some marketing. 

Toptal will interview you regarding machine learning.

You need to have a brand. It could just be your name. It could be a company. It helps remove sales objections more than anything else. It's not super important. Depends on where you are. If you have a business, you can just invoice. Otherwise, the company has to 1099 you. 

For legal help on this, go to rocketlawyer or something similar. 

But don't let building a company distract you from getting out and hustling. 

What skills are in low supply? 

Everyone can train and test a model. 

What a lot of people don't know how to do is really solve problems with machine learning and data science. Put together a complete solution. What is the point of building a model if nothing is done with it? Build a dashboard. Create a knowledge product. Create an end-to-end cloud-based  app. 

Marketing is about matching your skills to your customer's problems. You need to know what those problems are first. Get in front of a customer. Solve their problem with them.

"Shot across the bow." Reach out to people and say you've been working on a freelance business, and ask them for feedback on your strategy.
