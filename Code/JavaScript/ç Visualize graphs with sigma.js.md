Powerful way to visualize [[Networks]]. Uses [[WebGL]] instead of [[Canvas]] or [[SVG]], so it can render large graphs much faster. 

The drawback is that it is harder to develop customized rendering; if this is a requirement for the project, use [[รง d3.js]]. 

The https://www.sigmajs.org/ website has an incredible visualization of the Wikipedia graph for pages related to data visualization.
