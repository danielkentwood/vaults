```javascript

// intersection = keep only the elements that are common between a and b
let intersection = arr1.filter(x => arr2.includes(x));

// difference = keep elements from a, but exclude the intersection between a and b
let difference = arr1.filter(x => !arr2.includes(x));

// symmetric difference = keep all elements from a and b, except for the intersection between them
let symmetric_difference = arr1
                 .filter(x => !arr2.includes(x))
                 .concat(arr2.filter(x => !arr1.includes(x)));      
```
