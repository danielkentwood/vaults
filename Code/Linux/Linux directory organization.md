### Directory organization
- Bin is where the executables/binaries are. 
- Etc is where the configuration files are
- Home is where the home directories are
- Lib is where libraries are (python, compiled libraries, etc)
- Procs is where the process ids are stored
- opt is where people put installed application.
- Root = home folder of root user
- Sys = is a virtual subfolder, has information about kernel, not used often
- Usr = where are all of the user specific things are, but nowadays it is systemwide
- sbin = binaries for the root user
- Lib/lib64 = 32 v 64 bit libraries
- Include = header files
- Symlink = symbolic link. Redirection to another file. Often used for backward compatibility so that new software doesnâ€™t break
