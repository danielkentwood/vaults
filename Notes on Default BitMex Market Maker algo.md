# Notes on Default BitMex Market Maker algo

links:: [[Ï€ develop interface with exchange APIs]]

The highest level file that executes the strategy is **market_maker.py**

This file has two classes:

- ExchangeInterface
- OrderManager

It also has a few helper functions at the end of the file.

**ExchangeInterface**

This class is a set of functions for interacting with the exchange. Here are the definitions:

- __init__:
- cancel_order:
- cancel_all_orders:
- get_portfolio:
