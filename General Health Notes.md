1. **Sleep**
    1. Minimum 7 hours every day!!!!! This is the most important aspect of your health. YOU ARE SLEEP DEPRIVED. Goal is 8 hours.
    2. On weeknights, bedtime should be between 11:30-12:30.
2. **Cardio**
    1. Buy running shoes and start a running schedule
        1. Pose technique (it presumably helps with compartment syndrome)
        2. See physical therapist re: compartment syndrome
    2. Maybe invest in a bike trainer (and bike shoes)? Lower impact on body, and it will be good for really cold/wet days.
3. **Strength/Flexibility**
    1. Goal exercises
        1. Press to handstand
        2. Planche
    2. Stick to the flexibility and strength regimens

    2. Cut down on alcohol. Drink more water.

    4. WATER!
6. **Tracking**
    1. Start building your own software (using Python) for tracking and analyzing health progress
        1. Consider making it a website. Backend could be python/SQL.
    2. Track: sleep, specific exercises, # calories/carbs, weight, effectiveness/attention rating for the day, running/biking time and distance
7. **Cosmetic**
    1. Teeth (when finances are more stable)
    2. Corns (duct tape and clippers)
    3. Fungus (acid brush)

- plank to failure (record time). alternate leg lifts every 15 sec
- side plank to failure (record time). alternate support leg every 15 sec
- reverse plank to failure (record time). alternate leg lifts every 15 sec
- increase flexibility of back and legs (hold and breathe in each position for 30 sec)
