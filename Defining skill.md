##### First, a chatGPT session
>I'm going to provide a long list of entities. I want you to classify each of them as at least one of the following types: "skill", "activity", "tool", "platform", "object", "characteristic", "data type", "method", "algorithm", or "other". Before I give you the list, I want to ask if you think this is a good ontology. Can it be improved?

The ontology you provided seems comprehensive and covers a wide range of entities. However, it might be helpful to add a few more categories such as "framework", "technology", "language", "framework", "library" to further classify certain entities. Additionally, you may consider adding "concept" or "theory" as a category to classify abstract ideas or principles. Overall, the ontology seems good but with a few additional categories, it can be improved.

>Okay, here is the new ontology: - "skill" - "activity" - "tool" - "platform" - "object" - "characteristic" - "data type" - "method" - "algorithm" - "framework" - "technology" - "language" - "library" - "concept" - "theory" - "other"

Great, thank you for updating the ontology. Here is how I would classify the following entities:

1.  Python - "language"
2.  Photoshop - "tool"
3.  Gardening - "activity"
4.  Machine Learning - "technology", "concept"
5.  TensorFlow - "library", "framework"
6.  Hashing - "algorithm", "method"
7.  Twitter - "platform"
8.  Speed - "characteristic"

14.  Bluetooth - "technology"
15.  Intelligence - "characteristic", "concept"
16.  HTML - "language"
17.  CSS - "language"
18.  JavaScript - "language"
19.  React - "library", "framework"
20.  Git - "tool"

Please note that some of the entities can be classified into multiple categories.

-   Programming (Java, Python, C++, etc.)
-   Graphic Design
-   Data Analysis
-   Project Management
-   Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

>Earlier, when I asked you to classify "machine learning", you classified it as a "technology" and a "concept" but not a skill. In this list of skills, however, you included "machine learning". Is there a reason why you gave precedence to "technology" and "concept" over "skill" when classifying "machine learning"?

Yes, when I first classified "machine learning" as "technology" and "concept," I did so because it is a broad field that encompasses various techniques and technologies for training models and making predictions using data. As a technology, it refers to the use of algorithms, models, and techniques that allow machines to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. As a concept, it refers to the idea of a machine being able to learn and adapt to new data.

Including "machine learning" as a skill refers to the ability of an individual to understand and apply machine learning concepts, algorithms, and technologies to solve real-world problems and make predictions using data. Machine learning is a skill that is acquired through education, training, and practical experience. It is a field that requires knowledge and understanding of various mathematical concepts such as probability, statistics, linear algebra, and optimization. Therefore, it can be considered as a "skill" as well as a "technology" and "concept".

>I want to create a precise graph-based definition of "skill". Imagine that "skill" a type of node in our ontology. Let's assume that there is some pattern of connections that make it more likely that a given node should be classified as a "skill" node. For example, if the entity at that node can be used to perform some activity (e.g., "machine learning can be used to predict stock prices"), then we should also classify machine learning as a skill.

Yes, in a graph-based definition, "skill" can be represented as a node and connected to other nodes that are related to it. Here are some examples of connections and patterns that can be used to classify a node as a "skill" node:

-   A "skill" node is connected to nodes representing activities, such as "predicting stock prices" or "programming a website." This connection indicates that the skill can be used to perform a specific activity.
-   A "skill" node is connected to nodes representing tools or technologies, such as "Python" or "machine learning." This connection indicates that the skill involves the use of specific tools or technologies.
-   A "skill" node is connected to nodes representing knowledge, such as "mathematics" or "statistics." This connection indicates that the skill requires a certain level of knowledge in a specific field.
-   A "skill" node is connected to nodes representing characteristics, such as "creativity" or "problem-solving." This connection indicates that the skill involves specific characteristics or abilities.
-   A "skill" node is connected to nodes representing data types, such as "text" or "image." This connection indicates that the skill is applicable to specific types of data.

It's worth noting that a skill is not only a set of knowledge or a set of tools, but also the ability to apply them, to adapt them to different situations and to continuously improve.

Additionally, a skill node may be connected to nodes representing related skills, such as "programming" and "machine learning", indicating that the skill is related to or builds upon other skills.

##### And another chatGPT session
>What part of speech is the term "redundancy resolution"

"Redundancy resolution" is a noun phrase. It refers to the process of eliminating unnecessary redundancy or duplication in a system or process.

>What is it called when a verb becomes a noun? For example, when "to resolve" becomes "resolution"?

When a verb becomes a noun, it is called a "verbal noun" or "gerund" and the process is called "verbing". "Resolution" is an example of a gerund, as it is derived from the verb "resolve".

>Is there a special term for a noun phrase that contains a gerund?

A noun phrase that contains a gerund is also known as a gerund phrase. Gerund phrases always function as nouns in a sentence and typically include a gerund, which serves as the head of the phrase, and any words that modify or complement it.

For example, "the resolution of the problem" is a gerund phrase, where "resolution" is a gerund and "of the problem" is the complement of the phrase.

>what is the grammatical distinction between "the resolution of the problem" and "problem resolution"?

The grammatical distinction between "the resolution of the problem" and "problem resolution" is that they serve as different structures in a sentence. "The resolution of the problem" is a noun phrase made up of a definite article "the", a gerund "resolution", and a prepositional phrase "of the problem" . The gerund "resolution" functions as the head of the noun phrase, and "the" and "of the problem" function as a determiner and a modifier, respectively.

"Problem resolution" is a noun phrase made up of a noun "problem" and a gerund "resolution", where "resolution" functions as an adjective modifying the noun "problem". This structure is known as a compound noun.

In summary, the main distinction is that in "the resolution of the problem" the gerund "resolution" functions as the head of the noun phrase, whereas in "problem resolution" the gerund "resolution" functions as an adjective modifying the noun "problem".

>Do compound nouns always contain a gerund?

Compound nouns do not always contain a gerund. A compound noun is a noun made up of two or more words that function as a single unit. These words can be any combination of nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs. Gerunds can be one of the components of the compound noun, but it's not a requirement.

For example, "problem resolution" is a compound noun, where "problem" is a noun and "resolution" is a gerund. "Rainwater" is another example of compound noun, where "rain" is a noun and "water" is a noun. "Sleeping bag" is a compound noun, where "sleeping" is a participle adjective modifying the noun "bag".

So, in short, a compound noun can be made up of any combination of words, gerunds are one of the possibilities but not a requirement.

>Are there distinct terms for the different kinds of compound nouns? For example, is there a special term for a compound noun that contains a noun and a gerund versus one that contains two nouns?

There are different types of compound nouns, and they can be categorized based on the way the words are combined or the types of words used to form the compound noun. Some of the common types of compound nouns are:

-   Noun + noun: "Rainwater", "bookshelf"
-   Adjective + noun: "Sleeping bag", "hotdog"
-   Noun + verb/gerund: "problem resolution", "swimming pool"
-   Prepositional phrase + noun: "Mother-in-law", "salt-and-pepper"
-   Adverb + verb/gerund: "outgoing mail"

Each of these types of compound nouns has its grammatical rules and can be called in different ways. However, they don't have any distinct term that refers specifically to the different kinds of compound nouns. They are all compound nouns, but with different components.

>Please perform dependency parsing on this sentence: "He used machine learning to predict stock prices."

Dependency parsing is a natural language processing technique that involves analyzing the grammatical structure of a sentence by identifying the relationships between its words, specifically the syntactic dependencies between the words.

Here's how the dependency parse tree of the sentence "He used machine learning to predict stock prices." would look like:

-   "He" is the subject of the sentence, and its dependency relation is "nsubj".
-   "used" is the main verb of the sentence and its dependency relation is "ROOT"
-   "machine learning" is the object of the verb "used" and its dependency relation is "obj"
-   "to predict" is a prepositional phrase indicating the purpose of using machine learning and its dependency relation is "xcomp"
-   "stock prices" is the object of the verb "predict" and its dependency relation is "obj"

```
  used
 /    \
He    xcomp
     /    \
machine_learning  predict
                /    \
               to    obj
                     /    \
               stock_prices

```

Please note that the tree above is just an example of one possible way of parsing the sentence and there are other ways of parsing the sentence based on other parsing algorithms or models.

>is there such a thing as "verb phrase"?

Yes, there is such a thing as a "verb phrase." A verb phrase is a grammatical term that refers to a group of words that function together as a single verb in a sentence. It typically includes a main verb and any auxiliary verbs, particles, or adverbs that modify or complement it. A verb phrase can be a simple verb, such as "run," or a more complex combination of words, such as "should have been running."

A verb phrase can be a single word or multiple words and it can be composed of auxiliary verbs, main verb, adverbial particles, and adverbial phrases. For example: "He will have been running."

-   "will have been" is the auxiliary verb phrase
-   "running" is the main verb phrase

In short, a verb phrase is a group of words that function as a verb in a sentence, and it can be a single word or a combination of words.

>what part of speech is it when you have a transitive verb followed by a noun? e.g., "use machine learning" or "sing opera"

When you have a transitive verb followed by a noun, it is typically a verb phrase. A transitive verb is a verb that takes a direct object, which is the noun that follows it. In the examples you provided, "use" and "sing" are transitive verbs and "machine learning" and "opera" are their direct objects, respectively.

The whole phrase "use machine learning" or "sing opera" functions as a single unit in a sentence, indicating an action performed by the subject on the direct object. The direct object "machine learning" and "opera" receive the action of the transitive verb.

In summary, "use machine learning" and "sing opera" are verb phrases, where "use" and "sing" are the main verbs and "machine learning" and "opera" are the direct objects.

>Can you explain the dependency relation "xcomp"?

In dependency parsing, the dependency relation "xcomp" (also known as "open clausal complement") refers to a relationship between a main verb and a clause that functions as the complement of the main verb. The clause is typically introduced by a subordinating conjunction or a preposition, and it provides additional information about the main verb.

For example, in the sentence "He used machine learning to predict stock prices," the clause "to predict stock prices" is a prepositional phrase that functions as an xcomp to the main verb "used." The clause "to predict stock prices" modifies the main verb "used" by indicating the purpose of using machine learning.

In summary, xcomp is a dependency relation that connects a main verb to a clause that provides additional information about the main verb, usually introduced by a subordinating conjunction or a preposition.

>Is there a term for a sentence that ends with a verb phrase that contains a transitive verb and its direct object?

A sentence that ends with a verb phrase that contains a transitive verb and its direct object is called a "verb-final sentence." This structure is common in many languages and it is used to place emphasis on the action performed by the subject, as the direct object is typically the focus of the sentence.

Verb-final sentences are particularly common in languages such as Japanese, Chinese and Korean.

In English, this structure is less common, but it can be used for emphasis or to create a certain rhythm or style in the sentence.

In summary, "verb-final sentence" is a term used to refer to a sentence that ends with a verb phrase that contains a transitive verb and its direct object, this structure is less common in English but it can be used for emphasis or to create a certain rhythm or style in the sentence.

>give an example of a "verb-final sentence"

Here's an example of a verb-final sentence:

"The cake he baked was delicious."

In this sentence, "baked" is the transitive verb, "cake" is the direct object, and "was delicious" is the predicate complement. The sentence places emphasis on the action of baking the cake, and the direct object "cake" is the focus of the sentence.

Another example: "The concert he played in was amazing."

In this sentence, "played" is the transitive verb, "concert" is the direct object, and "was amazing" is the predicate complement. The sentence places emphasis on the action of playing in the concert, and the direct object "concert" is the focus of the sentence.

Please note that in English, verb-final sentence are less common but they can be used for emphasis or to create a certain rhythm or style in the sentence.

>is there a categorical difference between the verb "to be" and the verb "to make"?

Yes, there is a categorical difference between the verbs "to be" and "to make."

"To be" is a copular verb, also known as a linking verb, which connects the subject of a sentence to a subject complement, such as a noun, adjective, or adverb. In other words, "to be" is used to indicate the existence or identity of the subject. For example, in the sentence "The sky is blue," "is" connects the subject "sky" to the subject complement "blue," indicating that the sky has the property of being blue.

On the other hand, "to make" is a transitive verb, which takes a direct object and indicates an action performed by the subject on the object. "To make" indicates the creation or production of something. For example, in the sentence "He made a cake," "made" is the transitive verb, and "cake" is the direct object, indicating that the subject "he" created or produced a cake.

So, in summary, the main categorical difference between the verb "to be" and "to make" is that the first is a copular verb and the second is a transitive verb. "To be" is used to indicate the existence or identity of the subject, whereas "to make" indicates the creation or production of something.

>What is it called when a verb-final sentence ends with a transitive verb and a direct object, instead of a copular verb?

A sentence that ends with a transitive verb and a direct object, instead of a copular verb, is still called a "verb-final sentence." It is a sentence structure that places emphasis on the action performed by the subject, as the direct object is typically the focus of the sentence.

It is worth noting that in English, verbs other than copular verbs can also be used in verb-final sentence structures, and they can be used for emphasis or to create a certain rhythm or style in the sentence.

In the examples you gave before, "The cake he baked was delicious." and "The concert he played in was amazing." both are examples of verb-final sentences, where the transitive verbs "baked" and "played" are the last words of the sentences and the direct objects "cake" and "concert" are the focus of the sentence.

In summary, a sentence that ends with a transitive verb and a direct object, instead of a copular verb, is still called a "verb-final sentence" and it is a structure that places emphasis on the action performed by the subject.

>Suppose I remove the adjectives "delicious" and "amazing" from these sentences, and restructure them like this: - "He bakes cakes." - "He plays concerts." What is this structure called?

The structure you described is called a "bare infinitive" or "bare infinitive clause" structure. It is a structure where the verb is in its base form (infinitive without "to") and it is followed by its direct object. The subject of the sentence is implied and usually it is the same as the subject of the main clause.

In the examples you gave, "He bakes cakes." and "He plays concerts." the verbs "bake" and "play" are in their base form and are followed by the direct objects "cakes" and "concerts" respectively. The subject of these sentences is "He", and it is implied, as it is the same as the subject of the main clause.

This structure is often used to convey a sense of routine or habit. It's also used in some specific cases such as in imperative sentences, questions and in certain types of subordinate clauses.

In summary, the structure you described is called "bare infinitive" or "bare infinitive clause" structure and it is a structure where the verb is in its base form and it is followed by its direct object, the subject of the sentence is implied and usually it is the same as the subject of the main clause. This structure is often used to convey a sense of routine or habit and in specific cases such as in imperative sentences, questions and in certain types of subordinate clauses.

>Can you give more examples of bare infinitive clauses?

Sure! Here are a few examples of bare infinitive clauses:

-   "To study hard, you need to focus." (In this sentence, "to focus" is a bare infinitive clause modifying the infinitive phrase "to study hard" indicating the action that needs to be taken to achieve the goal.)
    
-   "It is hard to get up early." (In this sentence, "to get up early" is a bare infinitive clause functioning as the subject complement of the copular verb "is" indicating the difficulty of the action.)
    
-   "He likes to swim." (In this sentence, "to swim" is a bare infinitive clause indicating the action that the subject "he" likes.)
    
-   "Let's go! (In this sentence, "go" is a bare infinitive clause used as an imperative command.)
    
-   "I wondered how to fix it." (In this sentence, "to fix it" is a bare infinitive clause indicating the action that the subject "I" wondered about.)
    

In summary, bare infinitive clauses can appear in different contexts and in different parts of a sentence. They can be used as subject complements, direct objects, indirect objects, and in imperative sentences, as well as in different types of subordinate clauses to indicate the action or goal of a sentence.

>I want to create a set of bare infinitive clauses where the following conditions are met: - the subject is implied - there is a single transitive verb - there is a single direct object

Here are a few examples of bare infinitive clauses that meet the conditions you specified:

-   "Wash the dishes." (The subject is implied and "wash" is the transitive verb, and "dishes" is the direct object.)
    
-   "Clean the room." (The subject is implied and "clean" is the transitive verb, and "room" is the direct object.)
    
-   "Cook dinner." (The subject is implied and "cook" is the transitive verb, and "dinner" is the direct object.)
    
-   "Write a letter." (The subject is implied and "write" is the transitive verb, and "letter" is the direct object.)
    
-   "Take the dog for a walk." (The subject is implied and "take" is the transitive verb, and "dog" is the direct object.)
    
-   "Buy groceries." (The subject is implied and "buy" is the transitive verb, and "groceries" is the direct object.)
    

All the examples above are bare infinitive clauses and meet the conditions of the subject being implied, a single transitive verb, and a single direct object. Please note that these sentences are in the imperative mood, which is a common context for bare infinitive clauses, but there are also other contexts where you can find bare infinitive clauses.

>Let's modify the conditions slightly: - the sentence is in the imperative mood - the subject is implied - there is a single transitive verb - there is a single direct object - the direct object does not contain an article (for example, "rooms" instead of "the room")

Sure, here are a few examples of bare infinitive clauses in the imperative mood that meet the modified conditions you specified:

-   "Wash dishes." (The subject is implied, "wash" is the transitive verb, and "dishes" is the direct object without an article.)
    
-   "Clean rooms." (The subject is implied, "clean" is the transitive verb, and "rooms" is the direct object without an article.)
    
-   "Cook rice." (The subject is implied, "cook" is the transitive verb, and "rice" is the direct object without an article.)
    
-   "Write poetry." (The subject is implied, "write" is the transitive verb, and "poetry" is the direct object without an article.)
    
-   "Take dog for a walk." (The subject is implied, "take" is the transitive verb, and "dog" is the direct object without an article.)
    
-   "Buy apples." (The subject is implied, "buy" is the transitive verb, and "apples" is the direct object without an article.)
    

As you can see, all these examples are bare infinitive clauses and meet the modified conditions you specified: in the imperative mood, subject is implied, a single transitive verb, a single direct object, and the direct object does not contain an article. Please note that, in real-life usage, it is possible that some of the examples above may not be used in imperative mood in some cases and may be used in other grammatical moods.

>what part of speech is "in order to"?

The phrase "in order to" is a subordinating conjunction. Subordinating conjunctions are words that join a dependent clause to a main clause and indicate the purpose, reason, time, or manner of the action in the main clause.

The phrase "in order to" functions as a subordinating conjunction that introduces a dependent clause that indicates the purpose or reason for the action in the main clause. For example, "I will study in order to pass the exam." The main clause is "I will study" and the dependent clause is "in order to pass the exam." The dependent clause "in order to pass the exam" indicates the purpose or reason for the action of studying in the main clause.

In summary, "in order to" is a subordinating conjunction that is used to introduce a dependent clause indicating the purpose or reason for the action in the main clause.

##### Now, some thoughts

* "Skill" should not be a category in the ontology. Skill is a concept that refers to a human ability. There is no activity that is inherently a skill, but a human can develop skill in any activity.
* In the graph, a skill is defined (and quantified) by the following:
	* A chain of verbs or verb phrases ending with a verb phrase that contains a transitive verb and a direct object
		* example 1:
			* "use" (transitive verb)
			* "machine learning" (set of algorithms)
				* "in order to" (relation)
			* "predict" (transitive verb)
			* "stock prices" (object: data type)
		- example 2:
			- "sing" (transitive verb)
			- "opera" (object: performance type)
	* An artifact 

* In the knowledge graph, many activities will be compund noun-gerund phrases (e.g., "redundancy resolution") rather than verb phrases (e.g., "resolve redundancy").
- On the compositionality of skill: 
	- If someone were to isolate example 1 in the graph and tag it as a skill, ideally we could have heuristics or an AI that could help the person decompose that skill into its component parts. For example, it could ask:
		- Did you collect the data on your own? 
		- Did you come up wtih the question on your own, or was it given to you? 
		- Which language did you use?
		- Which packages, if any, did you use? 
		- Which machine learning algorithm did you use? 
		- Which model evaluation metric did you use? 
		- etc.
	- The goal is to make the decomposition process as frictionless as possible by guessing (based on the statistics of that decomposition) and interrogating.

* To summarize the platform:
	1. It uses a set of hierarchical graphs to construct candidate skill sentences, which are "imperative mood, bare infinitive clauses"
	2. It learns the statistics of compositionality between candidate skill sentences
	3. It helps users decompose their skills into component parts.
