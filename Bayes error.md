# Bayes error

Tags: [[ML optimization]]

Bayes optimal error is the theoretical limit to the performance of a machine learning system, given the input data. 

Progress in the performance of a machine learning system is rather fast until you reach human-level performance, after which it slows down and asymptotes. 

Why? 

1. human level performance is often pretty close to optimal in many cases.
2. human intelligence and intuition can give you tools to bring the model up to human-level performance, but once you surpass that, humans can't really help. When a model is worse than humans, you can:
	1. get labeled data from humans. 
	2. gain insight from manual error analysis. Why did a person get this right?
	3. perform better analysis of bias/variance.
