# Docking time
Often, we blast through our self-imposed schedule because we aren't at a convenient stopping point when it's time to move to the next task. We feel like we'll lose critical momentum if we stop now. How can we effectively "dock" the task so that it stays warm and we can hit the ground running when we pick it back up? 

* strategic calendaring that always leaves a short window (e.g., 5 minutes) between items so that you can:
	1. take notes that will orient you so that you can immediately pick back up when you come back to the task
	2. evaluate progress and make any necessary adjustments to the timeline
	3. notify any stakeholders if a communicated deadline is likely to be exceeded
* practice a pomodoro technique: break time into intervals, separated by 5 minutes of docking time and 5 minutes of break time (take a short walk, do exercises, refresh food/liquid stock, etc.)
