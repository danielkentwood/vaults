# k-nearest neighbors

Tags: [[classification]], [[regression]]

In KNN, the label for a sample is determined by taking the mean (in the case of regression) or majority (in the case of classification) label of the k nearest points. If you specify that $k=3$, then it will only use the 3 nearest points (using which distance metric? Euclidean?) to determine the label for each sample.
