> I want to assert that a human self can be fully expressed as a function of two things: (1) needs, and (2) the skills we deploy to satisfy those needs. In this model, needs can be any aversive internal state. Some of the earliest needs are physiological imbalances like hunger, fatigue, or disequilibrium. Other early needs are more social in nature. For example, infants need physical contact and interaction to help them regulate emotions and to facilitate bonding and attachment with their caregivers. The earliest skill that infants learn to help them satisfy their needs is the skill of crying. This alerts the caregiver to the fact that infant needs something, and the actual satisfaction of the need is carried out by caregiver. Another need that infants experience is the need to minimize motor error. That is, they need to accurately move their body in space.

> Needs have different levels:
> * ambiguous aversive state: this happens when either (1) a skill hasn't been developed for identifying and satisifying the need, or (2) the intensity of the need is low enough in relation to the other features of the current state that it isn't motivating behavior and it hasn't been identified. For example, I'm grumpy because I'm underslept, even though I don't realize that I'm underslept.
> * motivated aversive state: this happens when the intensity of the skill has increased sufficiently such that it is driving motivated behavior. This can happen without explicit awareness. For example, a baby starts to cry because it is tired, even though it doesn't necessarily know that it is tired. It is now engaging in a behavior that will increase the chances that the need will be satisfied.
> * thematic aversive state: this happens when the need is explicitly recognized as a need that requires the deployment of a specific skill in order to be satisified. For example, I notice that I am grumpy and short-tempered, and I realize that I must be underslept, so I take a nap.

> Can you summarize this in your own words and expand on the notion of needs?

Sure, in this model the human self is understood to be a function of two things: needs and the skills we use to satisfy those needs. Needs are internal states that are aversive or unpleasant in some way, and they can be physiological or social in nature. For example, infants have physiological needs like hunger and fatigue, and they also have social needs like the need for physical contact and interaction with caregivers. Skills are the means by which we satisfy our needs, and can range from simple behaviors like crying to alert caregivers to our needs, to more complex behaviors like using language to communicate our needs.

The concept of needs is central to this model, as it is the driving force behind the development of skills. Needs can be thought of as a type of internal motivation that drives us to develop and use skills to satisfy those needs. When a need is recognized and identified, it becomes a thematic aversive state, and we are motivated to use the skills we have developed to satisfy that need.

Overall, this model provides a framework for understanding how human selfhood is shaped by the interplay between our needs and the skills we use to satisfy them.

> [!Question] 
> I've talked about physiological and social needs so far. Let's add another category of need: sensorimotor. This category of need includes the basic human need to achieve enough perceptual precision to allow for accurate and effective movement in the environment. Do you understand this new category of sensorimotor need?

Yes, I understand the concept of sensorimotor needs. These are needs that relate to the basic human need to achieve sufficient perceptual precision in order to move accurately and effectively in the environment. This category of needs encompasses the various ways in which we use our senses to navigate the world around us, and the ways in which we use our motor abilities to interact with that world. Examples of sensorimotor needs include the need to see clearly in order to move accurately, the need to hear clearly in order to communicate effectively, and the need to touch and manipulate objects in order to use them. These needs are essential for our survival and well-being, and play a fundamental role in shaping our behavior and our experiences of the world.

> [!Question]
> Can you restate the three categories of need so far?

Sure, so far we have discussed three categories of need:

1.  Physiological needs: These are basic needs related to the functioning of the body, such as the need for food, water, and rest.
2.  Social needs: These are needs related to our interactions with other people, such as the need for physical contact, social connection, and attachment.
3.  Sensorimotor needs: These are needs related to the use of our senses and motor abilities to navigate and interact with the world around us. Examples include the need for visual, auditory, and tactile perception, as well as the need for effective movement and manipulation of objects.

> Exactly. We have three categories of need. 1. Physiological needs: These are basic needs related to the functioning of the body, such as the need for food, water, and rest. 2. Social needs: These are needs related to our interactions with other people, such as the need for physical contact, social connection, and attachment. 3. Sensorimotor needs: These are needs related to the use of our senses and motor abilities to navigate and interact with the world around us. Examples include the need for visual, auditory, and tactile perception, as well as the need for effective movement and manipulation of objects. Now I want to talk more about skills for satisfying needs. In this model, the development of a skill retroactively influence how the human experiences the need that is being satisfied. For example, someone who has lived in a cold climate from birth will have a refined set of skills for addressing the need to stay warm, and will experience coldness as a specific need to use one of those specific skills to efficiently warm up the body parts that are cold. On the other hand, someone who grew up in a warm, tropical climate from birth may experience coldness only as a need to deploy one or two skills (e.g., put on a thick coat, take a hot bath). Confronting a need initiates a process whereby the person creatively discovers a skill for satisfying the need, and with that satisfaction, the characteristic shape of the need. Metaphorically speaking, the need takes on the shape or the "flavor" of the skill that is most often deployed to satisfy it. Can you restate your understanding of skill and its relationship to need?

Sure, from what I understand, the development of skills for satisfying needs can retroactively influence how we experience those needs. For example, someone who has developed a wide range of skills for staying warm in cold weather will experience coldness as a specific need that can be satisfied by deploying one of those skills. On the other hand, someone who hasn't developed as many skills for staying warm in cold weather may simply experience coldness as a general discomfort that can be addressed with a few basic skills.

Overall, the development of skills can help us to more effectively identify and satisfy our needs, leading to a greater sense of balance and fulfillment in life. The specific skills that we use to satisfy our needs can also influence the "flavor" or character of those needs, shaping our experience of them.

> [!Question]
> The five-stage model of skill acquisition posits that someone who is learning a new skill passes through 5 distinct stages of development: (1) Novice, (2) Advanced Beginner, (3) Competence, (4) Proficient, and (5) Expert. Progress through these stages is characterized by changes in four binary qualities: * Recollection (non-situational or situational) * Recognition (decomposed or holistic) * Decision (analytical or intuitive) * Awareness (monitoring or absorbed) A novice has non-situational recollection, decomposed recognition, analytical decision making, and monitoring awareness. An advanced beginner is characterized by progression to situational recollection. A competent person is characterized by progression to holistic recognition. A proficient person is characterized by progression to intuitive decision-making. And an expert is characterized by progression to absorbed awareness. Can you integrate your understanding of the five-stage model of skill acquisition into your understanding of needs and skills that we already developed?

Yes, the five-stage model of skill acquisition describes the typical stages that a person goes through when learning a new skill. The stages are:

1.  Novice: In this stage, the person has a non-situational recollection of the skill, decomposed recognition of its elements, analytical decision-making, and monitoring awareness.
    
2.  Advanced Beginner: In this stage, the person progresses to situational recollection, recognizing the skill in the context in which it is used.
    
3.  Competence: In this stage, the person progresses to holistic recognition, seeing the skill as a whole rather than as a collection of individual elements.
    
4.  Proficient: In this stage, the person progresses to intuitive decision-making, relying on their experience and expertise to guide their actions.
    
5.  Expert: In this stage, the person progresses to absorbed awareness, performing the skill without conscious thought or effort.
    

These stages can be integrated with the concept of needs and skills that we have discussed by considering the relationship between the development of a skill and the satisfaction of a need. As a person progresses through the stages of skill acquisition, they become increasingly proficient at using that skill to satisfy a specific need. This can lead to a deeper understanding and experience of the need itself, as it takes on the characteristics of the skill used to satisfy it. For example, a novice who is learning to cook may initially experience the need for nourishment as a general, non-situational desire for food. As they become more skilled at cooking, they may progress to recognizing the need for nourishment in specific situations, such as when they are hungry or when they are cooking for others. Eventually, they may become proficient at using their cooking skills to satisfy their own and others' needs for nourishment, leading to a holistic understanding of the need and its relationship to the skill.

> [!Question]
> Exactly! Since skills retroactively determine our experience of needs, it logically follows that as we progress through the different stages of a skill, our experience of the need that the skill is satisfying will follow a similar trajectory through distinct stages. Can you expand more on this?

Sure, as we progress through the different stages of skill acquisition, our experience of the need that the skill is used to satisfy will also evolve. This is because the development of a skill can influence how we understand and experience a need, as the need takes on the characteristics of the skill used to satisfy it.

For example, a novice who is learning to cook may initially experience the need for nourishment as a general, non-situational desire for food. As they become more skilled at cooking, they may progress to recognizing the need for nourishment in specific situations, such as when they are hungry or when they are cooking for others. This progression from non-situational to situational recognition of the need is similar to the advanced beginner stage of skill acquisition, where the person begins to recognize the skill in the context in which it is used.

As the person continues to develop their cooking skills, they may progress to a holistic understanding of the need for nourishment, recognizing it as a complex and multifaceted need that involves not only the desire for food, but also the social and emotional aspects of sharing meals with others. This holistic understanding of the need is similar to the competent stage of skill acquisition, where the person sees the skill as a whole rather than as a collection of individual elements.

Finally, as the person becomes proficient at using their cooking skills to satisfy their own and others' needs for nourishment, they may develop an intuitive, effortless approach to decision-making when it comes to preparing and enjoying meals. This intuitive decision-making is similar to the proficient stage of skill acquisition, where the person relies on their experience and expertise to guide their actions.

Overall, the progression through the different stages of skill acquisition can be seen as mirrored by the progression of our experience of the need that the skill is used to satisfy. As we become more skilled at using a particular skill, our understanding and experience of the need itself deepens and becomes more nuanced.

> [!Question]
> Now I want to come back to the idea that the self is composed of needs and skills. The central idea is that needs and skills compose the self by progressively sharpening the boundary between an organism (e.g., a human body) and its environment. Indeed, each dyad of a need and a skill contains an implicit model of the interaction between the body and the environment. Our internal models of the body and the environment are, in fact, bundles of contextualized needs and skills. Outside of our needs and skills, there is no comprehensive internal model of the body or the environment. 
> 
> All human needs that make up the self require action for their satisfaction. By action, I mean intervention into the environment. When a human first encounters a new need, they explore, through action, a landscape of possible ways to satisify the need. Each action is accompanied by an expectation, derived from the internal models of adjacent needs and skills, of how the state of the body will be changed by the action, and how the state of the environment will be changed by the action. As actions are successful and the skill is consolidated, the actions associated with the skill more effectively isolate the changes driven by the body, which, by subtraction, clarifies which changes are driven by the environment. 
> 
> An example of this is when we hear a loud noise and we make a rapid eye movement toward the source of the noise. This ability to rapidly and precisely orient is not innate; it requires significant exploration while refining an integration between auditory and visual spatial localization. Just prior to the eye movement, the brain computes a copy of the motor command that will be sent to the eye muscles, and sends that copy to parts of the brain that will compare the expected outcome of the movement (derived from the internal model) with the true outcome of the movement. The internal model will then be updated with the magnitude of the error between the expected sensory outcome and the actual sensory outcome. 
> 
> As a human gradually refines a skill for satisfying a specific need, it progressively gets better at correctly attributing changes in the current state of the body to changes in the body itself or to changes in the environment, and it simultaneously gets better at correctly attributing changes in the current state of the environment to changes in the environment itself or to to changes in the body. This progressively improving attribution of state changes has the effect of sharpening the boundary between the body and its environment.

 Can you restate how needs and skills make up the self? 

Sure, it sounds like you're suggesting that needs and skills make up the self by progressively sharpening the boundary between the organism (e.g., a human body) and its environment. You also mentioned that each need-skill dyad contains an implicit model of the interaction between the body and the environment, and that our internal models of the body and environment are bundles of contextualized needs and skills. Furthermore, you explained that all human needs require action for their satisfaction, and that as a person explores different ways of satisfying a need through action, they develop expectations based on their internal models of adjacent needs and skills. As they successfully satisfy the need and consolidate the associated skill, they become better at attributing changes in the current state of the body and environment to the body or environment itself, which sharpens the boundary between the two. Is that a fair summary of your idea?

> [!Question]
> That's almost correct, but one small correction. I don't want to say that all human needs require action for their satisfaction. Rather, there is a subset of human needs that (along with the skills that satisfy them) compose the self because of the fact that they require action for their satisfaction. Some human needs can be satisfied without human action.

Ah, I see. Yes, you're correct that not all human needs require action for their satisfaction. Some needs, such as the need for air or water, can be satisfied automatically without any conscious effort on our part. However, there is a subset of needs that do require action for their satisfaction, and it is this subset of needs (along with the associated skills) that compose the self because of the way that they sharpen the boundary between the organism and its environment. Is that a better summary of your idea?
