### 2024

What are the highest value activities for 2024? 
1. Lead team to 2 new NBAs before June. Re-think the NBA process. Find the friction points. Demand more from partners. Work quickly.
2. TPA + Caregiver outreach
3. Auto SME

Other thoughts: 
* De-prioritize "ADRD provider only" for now. It's an incremental boost at most. Let's see if we can get vendor partnerships, incentives, etc., but let's prioritize other things. 
* Everything else needs to be shut down for now. Give minimal effort. Delegate.
