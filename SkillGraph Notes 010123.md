### Gamification ideas
##### Farming/Cultivation
- Farming analogy. Have a visualization of a tree/plant, and it gets bigger as the user connects more skills. Size is dependent on number of nodes.
- Health of the plant is dependent on amount/recency of validation. Are you continuing to use this knowledge/skill? Or is it something that is "withering on the vine"?
- You have a size score and a health score, both for each branch and in aggregate.
##### Cards/Rare items
* Skill Flows will be scored by how rare they are and how lucrative they are. 
* Archetypal Skill Flows will be encapsulated in cards -- we can use diffusion models to programatically generate card images at scale. 

### Validation
- Each form of validation pushes you to show/create some kind of artifact in the real world that demonstrates your skill.
