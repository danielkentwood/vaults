# trace of a matrix

related:: [[linear algebra]]

- brief description
    
    The trace of a matrix is the sum of elements on the main diagonal. 
    
    - The trace of a matrix is the sum of its complex eigenvalues
    - It is invariant with respect to a change of basis
    - It is only defined for a square matrix.

- formula
    
    $$
    tr(A) = \sum_{i=1}^na_{ii}=a_{11}+a_{22}+\cdot\cdot\cdot \ +a_{nn}
    $$
