# New Topics
## Choose a knowledge capture system
Find a frictionless way of mapping out concepts. I'm going to try the Obsidian app, which lets you connect notes into a graph.

## Compile some resources
Find resources that will give you the most basic overview of the topic. Review papers, article explainer videos on youtube, textbooks, wikipedia articles, etc. Don't spend too much time here. Even just two decent resources is enough to start. This presupposes some skill at [[evaluating learning resources]].

## First pass: Start the tree
Skim as quickly as possible and build a tree of concepts. Only delve into each concept as much as required to figure out where it belongs in the tree. Your goal here is to create placeholders and get the most basic gestalt sense of the topic. After you start seeing the same concepts repeated in new resources, stop this step. You don't need to be exhaustive. You'll continue to find new concepts even as an expert. Again, this is just a first pass. As you progress, be sure to identify which resources have more details about a particular topic.

## Second pass:



# Learning Math
One of the most difficult parts of learning math (for me, at least) is pattern recognition. Math is all about abstraction. Once you learn a formula or function, you can represent it with a symbol, and then that symbol becomes part of a new function, etc. Learning to instantly recognize the most common functions in your domain is essential. But how can I accelerate the process of training that pattern recognition? It would be great to build a corpus of in-the-wild examples of each core formula I learn, so that I can quickly browse through them, learn to quickly identify the formula, and also identify the role it is performing in context. 


# Explore vs Exploit

In research, you need to have 2 modes: explore and exploit. If you already have material to exploit, then exploit it. Learn how to quickly decide if the resource is useful, and keep a DB that contains notes and tags that describe the utility. When you run out of resources, it is time to explore again. But it is typically the case that you will stumble upon resources throughout your day. Get really fast at categorizing them for later exploitation, and this will reduce the amount of time you spend explicitly exploring. In fact, if you build an exploration pipeline through aggregators, newsletters, social media, etc., you can drastically reduce the amount of time you need to spend doing lit searches.


1. Cycle through procedures. 
2. Find the population that the procedure has been given to. 
3. Do cluster analysis of that population. 
4. Select the largest cluster. 
5. Find a pseudo control for that cluster. 
	1. match for member-level characteristics
	2. try to understand what predicts 
6.
