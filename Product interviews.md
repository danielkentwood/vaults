- **Book: Lean Analytics**
	- What needs to be built next?
	- You understand the bottom line, your users, etc.
	- Know how the company derives value from your product/project.
	- What should I build and what should I not build?
	- You should know exactly what the point of your product/project is.
	- How do you show good judgment in deciding what to work on next?

Types of products:

**Marketplace** is anything that brings people together to make a transaction.

They consist of providers and consumers.

Starting a marketplace is difficult. Cold start problem. The first place they tend to work on is supply. Lots of metrics are about balancing the supply and demand within the marketplace.

**SAS (software as a service)** typically has a subscription model.

KPI: Monthly recurring revenue (MRR and the change in MRR over quarters). Also annual recurring revenue.

Churn is another important metric.

- You always want to be sure about how your role specifically will add value to the company. How is this role related to improving the product? How will my role be measured? What is the metric?
- Be sure to have ideas about this before going into the interview. Being wrong about this is not as bad as not having thought about it at all.
- You should do enough research on the company that the interview feels like you are giving the interviewer a free consulting session.

1. Recommender systems
    1. In the end, recommender systems are for the paying customers. So you want to ultimately track two things:
        1. Conversion to higher paying tier.
        2. Churn.
2. Internal analytics
    1. You're trying to optimize bottom line of company?
        1. conversion rate
            1. marketing analytics
            2. Optimization of account sharing -- probably not a good idea to cut down on sharing entirely, since sharing might be an effective marketing tool. Do they have metrics for trying to understand how people convert from sharing to subscribing?
            3. optimization of actual sign-up UI.
        2. churn
        3. server costs (think about overhead as well as income) and other infrastructure questions
        4. Is the company in a growth or cost cutting mode?
        5. What are the statistics of the margins per customer? Does the company make lots of money from a small subset of customers, or does the company make small amounts of money from a very large subset of customers?

MARKETPLACE

AirBnB

Marketplace balance indicators. Supply and demand.

Know what lagging indicators are for the company. Think about the derivatives of the KPIs.

How would you evaluate the recommender system for AirBnB?

- return customers?
- favorite lists?
- likes?
- how many times you go back to it?

Best sources of literature on this are the startup literature?
